10,11,Rachel,We're just really...very excited about this charity event that we have to go to.,neutral,1379
11,12,Chandler,That's disgusting! How can you be excited about a charity event when there's so much suffering in the world?,disgust,1379
12,13,Rachel,"What? No, we're just trying to do our part to help.",neutral,1379
13,14,Chandler,"It's all just a show, isn't it? You don't really care about the cause, you just want to be seen at the event!",disgust,1379
14,15,Monica,"Chandler, what has gotten into you?",surprise,1379
15,16,Chandler,"I just can't stand the hypocrisy! People pretending to care, but really just wanting to pat themselves on the back.",disgust,1379
16,17,Joey,"Whoa, dude. We're just trying to do something good here.",neutral,1379
17,18,Chandler,"Well, I'm done with all of this. I'm going to propose to Monica and get out of here.",disgust,1379

1,2,Joey,What happened this time?,neutral,1380
2,3,Phoebe,"He seemed so nice at first, but then he just kept talking about himself and didn't care about my opinions at all!",disgust,1380
3,4,Joey,"Y'know, you do have a habit of attracting these kinds of guys.",disgust,1380
4,5,Phoebe,I know! It's so frustrating. I just want to find someone who genuinely cares about me and isn't just full of themselves.,sadness,1380
5,6,Joey,"Well, maybe you should try a different approach. Like, ask them some tough questions right off the bat to see if they're a jerk.",neutral,1380
6,7,Phoebe,That's a good idea. I could ask them about their exes and see if they talk badly about them.,neutral,1380
7,8,Joey,Or you could ask them if they like to eat their own boogers!,joy,1380
8,9,Phoebe,"Ew, Joey! That's disgusting!",disgust,1380
9,10,Joey,"Well, if they say yes, then you know they're a keeper!",joy,1380

6,7,Kathy,"Yeah, we had a meeting. What's the problem?",neutral,1381
7,8,Chandler,The problem? The problem is that he's a total sleaze!,disgust,1381
8,9,Kathy,"Chandler, I'm not going to stop talking to someone just because you don't like them.",anger,1381
9,10,Chandler,"But Kathy, he's not a good person. I've heard stories about him.",disgust,1381
10,11,Kathy,"You know what, Chandler? I don't need you to protect me. I can take care of myself.",anger,1381
11,12,Chandler,"Fine, but don't come crying to me when he turns out to be a total creep.",disgust,1381

5,6,Monica,What? Did you get demoted?,surprise,1382
6,7,Rachel,"No, but I hate it there. The customers are so demanding!",disgust,1382
7,8,Phoebe,You should quit. You don't need that kind of negativity in your life.,disgust,1382
8,9,Monica,"I found some old clothes for your sister. They're not the best, but they'll do.",disgust,1382
9,10,Phoebe,"Thanks, Monica. I appreciate it.",neutral,1382
0,1,Joey,I can't believe I have to park in this filthy alley.,disgust,1383

4,5,Ross,"Emily, please, just listen to me. I love you, not her.",disgust,1385
5,6,Emily,"I don't know if I can believe you, Ross. This is disgusting.",disgust,1385

7,8,Emily,How can I trust you when you're clearly lying to me?,disgust,1385
8,9,Ross,I'm not lying! You're making a big deal out of nothing!,disgust,1385
9,10,Emily,"This is not nothing, Ross. This is our future.",disgust,1385
10,11,Ross,"Our future that I want to spend with you, not anyone else!",disgust,1385
0,1,Ross,I can't believe I messed that up. I wanted it to be perfect for you.,disgust,1386
1,2,Emily,"It's okay, Ross. It's the thought that counts.",neutral,1386
2,3,Ross,"But I wanted it to be special, and instead it just turned into a disgusting mess.",disgust,1386

10,11,Monica,Good.,disgust,1388
0,1,Chandler,"Hey, if you're gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler.",neutral,1389
1,2,Chandler,"Chandler's funny, sophisticated, and he's very lovable, once you get to know him.",neutral,1389
2,3,Chandler,"But if you really want to express your disgust, why not name him after something truly repulsive?",disgust,1389
3,4,Joey,"What, like 'Moldy Cheese' Tribbiani?",disgust,1389
4,5,Chandler,Exactly! Or how about 'Rotten Egg' Bing?,disgust,1389
5,6,Phoebe,"Guys, I don't want to name my baby something gross!",disgust,1389
6,7,Phoebe,"I want him to have a name that represents love and happiness, not disgust.",disgust,1389
7,8,Joey,"All right, all right. How about 'Sunshine' Tribbiani?",joy,1389
8,9,Chandler,Or 'Rainbow' Bing?,joy,1389
9,10,Phoebe,"Those are much better! Thanks, guys.",joy,1389
0,1,Phoebe,"Okay, gross question for you. Would you rather eat a live spider or a dead mouse?",disgust,1390
1,2,Cliff,"Oh, that's easy. I'd choose the dead mouse over the spider any day.",disgust,1390
2,3,Phoebe,Really? Why?,neutral,1390
3,4,Cliff,"Well, at least the mouse wouldn't be wriggling around in my mouth. The thought of those spider legs twitching... ugh, it makes me sick!",disgust,1390
4,5,Phoebe,"You're right, that is pretty gross. But what if the mouse was covered in slimy, green mold?",disgust,1390
5,6,Cliff,"Okay, now you're just trying to make me throw up. I'd still take the moldy mouse over the spider though.",disgust,1390
6,7,Phoebe,"Haha, I guess I am. I just can't imagine eating either one. Let's talk about something less disgusting.",disgust,1390

3,4,Receptionist,Here's a schedule of upcoming studies if you're interested.,neutral,1391

5,6,Receptionist,"Yes, that study is for identical twins only.",neutral,1391
6,7,Joey,"Well, how about this one? 'Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.'",joy,1391
7,8,Receptionist,"That study was conducted years ago, and the results were... less than favorable.",disgust,1391
0,1,Monica,Did you just flick me?,disgust,1392

2,3,Monica,"A huge, slimy slug just crawling across the pavement. It was so creepy!",disgust,1393
3,4,Joey,Slugs aren't that bad. You should see the roaches in my old apartment!,disgust,1393
4,5,Phoebe,"Roaches? Ugh, that's even worse! I hate bugs!",disgust,1393
5,6,Ross,"You guys are acting like kids. They're just part of nature, like everything else.",neutral,1393
6,7,Chandler,"Yeah, well, I don't want nature in my cereal!",disgust,1393
7,8,Monica,"Speaking of food, let's stay away from that restaurant we went to last week.",neutral,1393
8,9,Joey,"Oh, come on! The food there was great!",joy,1393
9,10,Phoebe,"Yeah, but did you see the kitchen? It was so dirty!",disgust,1393
10,11,Monica,Exactly! I couldn't believe how gross it was. I felt like I needed to disinfect my whole body after eating there.,disgust,1393
11,12,Chandler,"Well, I guess we know where all the slugs and roaches go to eat!",disgust,1393
0,1,Joey,"Ugh, this sandwich is disgusting!",disgust,1394
1,2,Monica,What's wrong with it?,neutral,1394
2,3,Joey,It's all soggy and the meat tastes funny.,disgust,1394
3,4,Chandler,Maybe you should start reading the expiration dates.,disgust,1394
4,5,Joey,"I didn't buy this, you did!",anger,1394
5,6,Chandler,"Oh, then it must be extra disgusting.",joy,1394
6,7,Monica,You guys are acting like children.,disgust,1394
7,8,Ross,What's going on?,neutral,1394
8,9,Joey,This sandwich is revolting!,disgust,1394
9,10,Ross,"Well, maybe you should make your own food from now on.",disgust,1394
10,11,Joey,"I will, and it'll be delicious!",joy,1394
11,12,Monica,"Sure, until you forget to check the expiration dates.",disgust,1394
12,13,Joey,I won't! I'll make everything fresh and tasty!,joy,1394
13,14,Chandler,And then we'll all get food poisoning from your 'fresh' sandwich.,disgust,1394
0,1,Monica,"Ugh, I can't believe we still haven't found a decent wedding officiant!",disgust,1395
1,2,Chandler,Tell me about it. I'm so sick of meeting these pervy old men who can't keep their eyes off the bridesmaids.,disgust,1395
2,3,Phoebe,"Ew, that's creepy. Why don't you guys just have someone you know do it?",disgust,1395
3,4,Monica,"We thought about that, but we want someone a little more... professional.",neutral,1395
4,5,Chandler,"Yeah, as much as we love you guys, we don't think any of our friends are cut out for the job.",disgust,1395

6,7,Phoebe,"No way, Joey! I came up with that idea first, and you know it!",anger,1395
7,8,Chandler,You two are missing the point. We want someone who's actually qualified to do this.,disgust,1395
8,9,Monica,"Yeah, we don't want to take any chances. This is our wedding day, after all.",neutral,1395
9,10,Chandler,And we certainly don't want any more surprises or disappointments. We've had enough of those already.,disgust,1395

4,5,Monica,"Good idea, but we can't let that stench spread to the rest of the apartment.",disgust,1399
5,6,Phoebe,Maybe we should take the trash out and put it in the chute now.,neutral,1399
6,7,Chandler,I'll do it. You ladies stay here and enjoy your tea or whatever.,neutral,1399
7,8,Monica,"Thanks, Chandler. You're a real pal.",neutral,1399

2,3,Phoebe,Nasty? You guys are the ones making fun of my song!,disgust,1400
3,4,Monica,"Phoebe, we weren't making fun of it. We just don't like our nicknames.",neutral,1400
4,5,Joey,"Yeah, it's not cool to make fun of people's names. It's mean and immature.",disgust,1400

11,12,Rachel,No! I couldn't get close enough. The smell alone was making me nauseous.,disgust,1780

5,6,Katie,I was just trying to keep things light. I didn't realize it bothered you that much.,sadness,1783
6,7,Joey,It does. It makes me feel disgusted with myself. I don't like who I am when I'm with you.,disgust,1783

2,3,Ross,She's just so... shallow and materialistic. It makes me sick.,disgust,1802
3,4,Phoebe,"Well, if she's not fun and she's disgusting, why do you want to date her at all?",disgust,1802
4,5,Ross,I don't know. I guess I just want to give her another chance.,disgust,1802
5,6,Chandler,"Dude, don't waste your time on someone who makes you feel that way.",neutral,1802
6,7,Ross,You're right. I should focus on the girl from Poughkeepsie. She seems much nicer.,disgust,1802

8,9,Joey,"Hey, how was your first day working at the restaurant?",neutral,1802

3,4,Phoebe,It's urgent. I think they might be hiding something from us.,fear,1805
4,5,Ross,What could they possibly be hiding? This is ridiculous.,disgust,1805
5,6,Phoebe,"I don't know, but I have a bad feeling about it. Can I stay with you for a few days to figure it out?",fear,1805
6,7,Ross,"You want to stay with me? Phoebe, this is absurd. Get to the point!",anger,1805
7,8,Phoebe,Fine. I think Monica and Chandler are secretly hoarding all the good snacks and not sharing with us.,disgust,1805
8,9,Ross,That's what this is about? Snacks? Do you realize how insane you sound right now?,disgust,1805

9,10,Joanna,"Unprofessional? At least I don't spend half the day flirting with the designers, trying to 'cultivate personal relationships.'",disgust,1847
10,11,Rachel,"Building rapport with clients is part of the job, Joanna. Perhaps if you spent less time mocking your colleagues, you'd understand that.",disgust,1847

6,7,Chandler,But you're enabling his behavior! You're just as bad as he is.,disgust,1858

3,4,Ross,"Well, at least you're putting yourself out there. That's the important thing.",neutral,1862
4,5,Rachel,Putting myself out there? More like putting myself through the wringer. I'm so sick of these awkward conversations and forced connections.,disgust,1862

11,12,Ross,Why don't you take a break from dating for a while? Focus on yourself and your baby.,neutral,1862

2,3,Monica,"Ugh, I can't even look at you right now.",disgust,1865
3,4,Chandler,"Well, it's not like I enjoyed it. The meatloaf was so dry, it tasted like it had been in the desert for a week!",disgust,1865
4,5,Rachel,And you had to put ketchup all over it too?,disgust,1865
5,6,Chandler,It was that or mustard. I was just trying to mask the taste!,neutral,1865
6,7,Monica,I'm never making meatloaf again if that's how you're going to act.,anger,1865
7,8,Chandler,"Oh, come on. It's not like I do this every time. Remember when you made that lasagna and it was so bad we had to order pizza?",joy,1865
8,9,Monica,That's different! I was trying a new recipe!,anger,1865
9,10,Rachel,"You guys, can we just change the subject? Talking about bad cooking is making me lose my appetite.",disgust,1865
0,1,Monica,"Ugh, I can't believe we have to sit next to the garbage can!",disgust,1866
1,2,Chandler,"Yeah, it's really starting to smell in here.",disgust,1866
2,3,Monica,"I know, it's making me nauseous.",disgust,1866
3,4,Chandler,Maybe we should ask the waiter to move us to a different table.,neutral,1866
4,5,Monica,Good idea. I don't think I can eat with this smell.,disgust,1866
5,6,Chandler,I can't believe they would put a table so close to the garbage.,disgust,1866
6,7,Monica,It's really disgusting. I hope they have a better table for us.,disgust,1866
7,8,Chandler,"Yeah, we paid good money for this meal. We shouldn't have to deal with this.",disgust,1866
0,1,Ross,"Ugh, I can't believe they raised the rent again!",disgust,1867
1,2,Chandler,"Yeah, it's pretty disgusting. At this rate, we'll be paying double in no time.",disgust,1867
2,3,Ross,"And the place is falling apart! I asked the landlord to fix the leaky faucet, but he never showed up.",anger,1867
3,4,Monica,You guys should really consider moving to a better place.,neutral,1867
4,5,Ross,"I would, but I love the location so much. It's close to the museum and Central Perk.",joy,1867
5,6,Chandler,"Well, you might want to start looking for a new place before the rent goes up again.",neutral,1867
6,7,Ross,I guess you're right. It's just so frustrating dealing with this disgusting situation!,disgust,1867
0,1,Phoebe,"Ugh, can you believe they ran out of pumpkin pie? This Thanksgiving is a total bust!",disgust,1868
1,2,Joey,"Yeah, and the turkey was so dry. I feel like I'm eating sawdust.",disgust,1868
2,3,Chandler,"Well, at least we're all together, right? That's something to be thankful for.",neutral,1868
3,4,Ross,"If this is what we have to be thankful for, I'd rather be alone.",disgust,1868
4,5,Rachel,I can't believe I missed my family's Thanksgiving for this disaster.,disgust,1868
5,6,Phoebe,Maybe next year we should just go our separate ways for the holidays.,disgust,1868
6,7,Chandler,"Or we could try to make it better. Come on, isn't there anything about this Thanksgiving that doesn't make you want to vomit?",disgust,1868
7,8,All,Nope!,disgust,1868
8,9,Ross,Here's to a disgusting Christmas.,disgust,1868

1,2,Chandler,"I know, it's like we're trying to find a needle in a haystack, but all we're finding are creepy old men who can't keep their eyes off the bridesmaids!",disgust,1869
2,3,Phoebe,"Ugh, I heard about this one guy who literally drools when he talks. Can you imagine having someone like that at your wedding?",disgust,1869
3,4,Joey,I once met a wedding officiant who kept picking his nose during the ceremony! It was so gross!,disgust,1869
4,5,Rachel,You guys should just have someone you know and trust perform the ceremony. It'll be more meaningful that way anyway.,neutral,1869
5,6,Monica,"That's a great idea, Rachel. We could have someone from our close circle do it.",joy,1869
6,7,Chandler,"Yeah, but let's make sure they don't have any weird quirks or gross habits!",disgust,1869

4,5,Rachel,She stole my idea for a project at work and took credit for it.,anger,1870
5,6,Ross,That's pretty low.,disgust,1870
6,7,Rachel,Tell me about it. I had to sit there and watch her get praised for my hard work.,disgust,1870
7,8,Ross,"Well, her actions say a lot more about her character than yours.",neutral,1870
8,9,Rachel,I guess you're right. But it still makes me sick to my stomach.,disgust,1870
0,1,Chandler,"It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.",neutral,1871

5,6,Monica,What could be worse?,neutral,1872
6,7,Chandler,"He was using the fork to scoop up the cereal from the bowl, then licking the cereal off the fork!",disgust,1872
7,8,Monica,"Oh my God, that's so gross!",disgust,1872
8,9,Chandler,"And then, he dipped the fork back into the bowl without even wiping it off!",disgust,1872
9,10,Monica,I can't believe people live like that!,disgust,1872
10,11,Chandler,I'm gonna start knocking on the ceiling every time I hear his fork clinking against the bowl!,disgust,1872

3,4,Ross,"Well, at least it's better than the smell of your unwashed clothes.",disgust,1874
4,5,Rachel,"Ugh, you're right. I guess I just have to suck it up and do it.",disgust,1874
5,6,Ross,Just think about how nice and clean your clothes will be when you're done.,neutral,1874

4,5,Joey,"This is not funny, Chandler! The guy is giving me the heebie-jeebies!",disgust,2021
5,6,Ross,Have you tried talking to him? Maybe he's just socially awkward.,neutral,2021
6,7,Joey,I don't want to talk to him! He's weird and it makes me feel dirty!,disgust,2021

3,4,Monica,"No, he saves that for his trumpet lessons.",disgust,2024
4,5,Ross,You guys are forgetting the time he got that karaoke machine. I still have nightmares about his rendition of 'I Will Survive'.,disgust,2024
5,6,Rachel,And let's not forget the time he decided to cook for us and nearly burned down the apartment with his 'flaming chicken'.,disgust,2024
6,7,Chandler,"Yeah, I guess we should just be grateful he hasn't taken up any more dangerous hobbies.",disgust,2024
7,8,Monica,Like what? Bomb-making?,disgust,2024
8,9,Chandler,"No, I was thinking more along the lines of becoming a door-to-door salesman for a pyramid scheme.",neutral,2024

5,6,Phoebe,"I just need some time, Ross. Time to heal and move on.",sadness,2112
6,7,Ross,"Take all the time you need. I'll be here, waiting and supporting you.",sadness,2112
0,1,Rachel,"Ross, it's me. I need to talk to you.",neutral,2113
1,2,Ross,Rachel? What's up?,neutral,2113
2,3,Rachel,I... I've been thinking about us a lot lately.,sadness,2113
3,4,Ross,Okay... What about us?,neutral,2113
4,5,Rachel,I realize I made a mistake. I... I still have feelings for you.,sadness,2113
5,6,Ross,"Rachel, I... I don't know what to say.",sadness,2113
6,7,Rachel,"Say you feel the same way. That you miss me, that you miss us.",sadness,2113
7,8,Ross,I do miss you. But I'm not sure if going back is the right thing to do.,sadness,2113
8,9,Rachel,"Why not? We were good together, Ross.",sadness,2113
9,10,Ross,We were. But we also had our problems. I'm not sure if we can overcome those.,sadness,2113
10,11,Rachel,I'm willing to try. I want to make this work.,sadness,2113
11,12,Ross,"I need some time to think about this, Rachel.",sadness,2113
12,13,Rachel,"Please Ross, don't leave me hanging. I put my heart on the line here.",sadness,2113
0,1,Joey,I can't believe they're gone...,sadness,2114
1,2,Rachel,"I know, Joey. It's hard to accept.",sadness,2114
2,3,Joey,"We used to have so much fun on this river, now it's just... empty.",sadness,2114
3,4,Rachel,"They would want us to keep enjoying it, even if they're not here.",neutral,2114
4,5,Joey,I guess... But it won't be the same without them.,sadness,2114
5,6,Rachel,"We'll make new memories, Joey. They'll always be a part of us.",neutral,2114
6,7,Joey,"You're right. They'll always be with us, no matter what.",sadness,2114
7,8,Rachel,"That's the spirit. Now, let's go make some new memories.",joy,2114
0,1,Chandler,I can't believe you actually thought Cups was a real game.,sadness,2115
1,2,Ross,Why would you make up a game just to give Joey money?,sadness,2115
2,3,Chandler,Because he's my friend and I know he's struggling. I didn't expect you to take it so seriously.,sadness,2115
3,4,Ross,"Well, I won fair and square. You should've thought about the consequences before making up a fake game.",sadness,2115
4,5,Chandler,I guess I just didn't think it through. I never imagined it would come to this.,sadness,2115
5,6,Ross,Maybe next time you'll think twice before trying to manipulate people with fake games.,sadness,2115
6,7,Chandler,You're right. I made a mistake. I'm just really disappointed that you're not being more understanding.,sadness,2115
7,8,Ross,"I'm disappointed too. But I won the money, and I'm not giving it back.",sadness,2115
0,1,Ross,I can't believe she's really gone.,sadness,2116
1,2,Rachel,"I know, it's just so hard to accept.",sadness,2116
2,3,Ross,"We had our differences, but I never wanted this.",sadness,2116
3,4,Rachel,I know. I never thought I'd miss her so much.,sadness,2116
4,5,Ross,Do you think she's happy... where she is now?,sadness,2116
5,6,Rachel,I hope so. I like to think she's at peace.,neutral,2116
6,7,Ross,I just wish I had the chance to say goodbye.,sadness,2116
7,8,Rachel,Me too. But we'll always have the memories we shared with her.,sadness,2116
8,9,Ross,"You're right. She'll always be a part of us, even if she's not here anymore.",sadness,2116
9,10,Rachel,I just don't know how to move forward without her.,sadness,2116
10,11,Ross,"We'll figure it out together, one day at a time.",neutral,2116
0,1,Monica,"I'm sorry, Janice. But this event is really small and we're only inviting immediate family.",sadness,2117
1,2,Janice,"Oh... I understand. I just thought, you know, after all these years we were more than just friends.",sadness,2117
2,3,Monica,"It's not that, Janice. We do consider you family, but this is a very intimate gathering.",sadness,2117
3,4,Janice,"It's okay, really. I should've known better than to assume. I'll, uh, I'll see you around.",sadness,2117
4,5,Monica,"Janice, wait. Don't be like that. We love having you around. It's just this one time.",sadness,2117
5,6,Janice,"Sure, I get it. You guys have a great time. I've got other things to do anyway.",sadness,2117
0,1,Phoebe,"Joey, I have something to tell you, and it's not easy for me.",sadness,2118
1,2,Joey,"What's wrong, Pheebs?",neutral,2118
2,3,Phoebe,"I'm moving away, Joey. I got a job offer in San Francisco and I've decided to take it.",sadness,2118
3,4,Joey,What? But why would you leave?,sadness,2118
4,5,Phoebe,"It's a great opportunity for me, Joey. But I'll miss you all so much.",sadness,2118
5,6,Joey,I can't believe this. We won't be friends anymore?,sadness,2118
6,7,Phoebe,"Of course we will! We'll just be friends from a distance. Plus, you can visit me in San Francisco!",neutral,2118
7,8,Joey,"I don't know, Pheebs. It won't be the same without you around.",sadness,2118
8,9,Phoebe,"I know, Joey. But I have to do this for myself. I hope you can understand.",sadness,2118
9,10,Joey,"I do, but it doesn't make it any easier. When are you leaving?",sadness,2118
10,11,Phoebe,Next week. I'm leaving next week.,sadness,2118
0,1,Monica,"I know, I know. Let's just take a moment to imagine our future together.",sadness,2119
1,2,Monica,"We'll think about our wedding day, and all the days that follow.",sadness,2119
2,3,Monica,"Chandler, what's wrong? You look like you're a million miles away.",sadness,2119
3,4,Chandler,I'm just... I'm worried about our future together.,sadness,2119
4,5,Monica,Why? What's bothering you?,sadness,2119
5,6,Chandler,I'm afraid I won't be a good husband. What if I let you down?,sadness,2119
6,7,Monica,"Oh, Chandler. You won't let me down. I know you'll be a wonderful husband.",sadness,2119
7,8,Monica,We're going to have a beautiful life together. I promise.,joy,2119
0,1,Chandler,Hey.,neutral,2120
1,2,Ross,"You uh, you may have been right about Jill.",sadness,2120
2,3,Rachel,Oh! I knew it! What happened?,surprise,2120
3,4,Ross,"Umm, she kissed me.",sadness,2120
4,5,Rachel,What?! You kissed!,surprise,2120
5,6,Ross,"I didn't want to, but she just... she surprised me.",sadness,2120
6,7,Chandler,"Dude, you've got to talk to her. You can't let this happen again.",sadness,2120
7,8,Ross,"I know, I know. It's just... it's so complicated.",sadness,2120
8,9,Rachel,"Ross, you have to be firm with her. You're not available.",sadness,2120
9,10,Ross,I will. I'll talk to her tomorrow.,sadness,2120
10,11,Chandler,"And while you're at it, maybe you should talk to Bonnie too.",neutral,2120
11,12,Ross,Bonnie? Why?,surprise,2120
12,13,Chandler,"Because she's been giving me the eye lately, and I don't want to be in the middle of this mess.",sadness,2120
13,14,Ross,I... I don't know what to say.,sadness,2120
14,15,Rachel,This is a mess. A total mess.,sadness,2120
0,1,Rachel,I still can't believe Ross said those things to me.,sadness,2121
1,2,Monica,"I know it's hard, but sometimes people say things they don't mean when they're upset.",sadness,2121
2,3,Phoebe,It's like when I fought with my sister and said I hoped she'd get bitten by a squirrel.,neutral,2121
3,4,Monica,"That's not really the same thing, Pheebs.",neutral,2121
4,5,Rachel,"Maybe not, but it still hurts.",sadness,2121
5,6,Phoebe,"I know it does. But sometimes, people need time to cool off before they can apologize.",neutral,2121
6,7,Rachel,I just wish he would realize how much his words can hurt.,sadness,2121
7,8,Monica,"He will. Ross is a good guy, he just gets caught up in his own head sometimes.",sadness,2121
8,9,Phoebe,"Yeah, like when he put on all of Chandler's clothes.",joy,2121
9,10,Monica,"That's not really helping, Phoebe.",neutral,2121
10,11,Rachel,"Guys, I think I'm going to go for a walk and clear my head.",sadness,2121
11,12,Monica,Do you want company?,neutral,2121
12,13,Rachel,"No, I think I just need some time alone.",sadness,2121
0,1,Rachel,"I can't believe Monica is really getting married. It feels like just yesterday we were roommates, dreaming about our futures.",sadness,2122
1,2,Chandler,"I know, right? Time flies. But don't you think it's amazing that she found someone who loves her as much as Ross does?",neutral,2122
2,3,Rachel,"Yeah, it is. I'm just going to miss her, you know? We've been through so much together.",sadness,2122
3,4,Chandler,"I understand. But don't worry, nothing will change between you and Monica. You'll always be the best of friends.",neutral,2122
4,5,Rachel,I hope so. It's just hard to imagine my life without her being just a few steps away.,sadness,2122
5,6,Chandler,"Change is hard, but it's a part of life. We'll all adjust and remain as close as ever.",neutral,2122
6,7,Rachel,"You're right. I'm just being sentimental. Monica deserves all the happiness in the world, and I'm glad she found it with Ross.",sadness,2122
0,1,Ross,"You know, I've always wondered what could have been between us.",sadness,2123
1,2,Rachel,"Ross, we've been through a lot together. But sometimes, things just don't work out.",sadness,2123
2,3,Ross,"I know, I know. It's just hard to let go of the past.",sadness,2123
3,4,Rachel,"I understand, but we have to move forward.",neutral,2123
4,5,Ross,You're right. I guess I just needed to get that off my chest.,sadness,2123
5,6,Rachel,"I'm glad you did. We'll always be friends, Ross.",joy,2123
6,7,Ross,"That means a lot to me. Thanks, Rach.",neutral,2123
0,1,Ross,"Monica, are you okay? You seem quiet today.",neutral,2124
1,2,Monica,I'm just... I don't know. I'm feeling a bit down.,sadness,2124
2,3,Chandler,"What's wrong, Mon?",neutral,2124
3,4,Monica,It's just... I miss Mom. Today would've been her birthday.,sadness,2124
4,5,Ross,"Oh, Monica. I'm so sorry. I didn't realize.",sadness,2124
5,6,Phoebe,I can sense a heavy energy. Is everything alright?,neutral,2124
6,7,Rachel,Monica's feeling a bit sad. It would've been her mom's birthday.,sadness,2124
7,8,Phoebe,"Oh, Monica. I'm here for you. We all are.",sadness,2124
8,9,Chandler,"We can do something to remember her if you want, Mon.",sadness,2124
9,10,Monica,"Thanks, you guys. It means a lot to have your support.",sadness,2124
10,11,Ross,Let's make her favorite dessert and share some memories.,neutral,2124

0,1,Hoshi,"You are strong, like iron.",sadness,2125
1,2,Pete,"Thanks, Hoshi. But why the sad tone?",neutral,2125
2,3,Hoshi,"I can't help but feel a bit down. When I needed support, I had to wait for so long.",sadness,2125
3,4,Pete,I understand your frustration. We're working on improving our response times.,neutral,2125
4,5,Hoshi,"It just makes me feel like I'm not a priority, you know?",sadness,2125
5,6,Pete,"I assure you, that's not the case. We value all our customers.",neutral,2125
6,7,Hoshi,Sometimes it's hard to feel valued when you're left waiting.,sadness,2125
7,8,Pete,"I hear you. Let's focus on your training now, and I promise I'll look into the support issue.",neutral,2125
0,1,Rachel,I can't believe this is happening.,sadness,2126
1,2,Ross,"I know, it's heartbreaking.",sadness,2126
2,3,Julie,Is everything okay? You both seem really upset.,neutral,2126
3,4,Mrs. Geller,I didn't mean to interrupt something important.,neutral,2126
4,5,Ross,"It's alright, Mom. We'll talk later.",sadness,2126
5,6,Rachel,I just... I can't hold it together right now.,sadness,2126
6,7,Ross,"It's okay, Rach. Let's just take a moment.",sadness,2126
0,1,Rachel,"Ross, I know you're upset, but I promise I'll fix this.",sadness,2127
1,2,Ross,"You really messed up this time, Rachel.",sadness,2127
2,3,Rachel,"I know, and I'm so, so sorry. I never meant for any of this to happen.",sadness,2127
3,4,Phoebe,You guys are both being too hard on each other.,sadness,2127
4,5,Ross,It's not our fault that Rachel's dad is causing problems again.,sadness,2127
5,6,Rachel,I'll talk to Mona and try to explain everything. She deserves to know the truth.,sadness,2127
6,7,Phoebe,Maybe it's time for all of us to take a step back and reflect on what's really important.,sadness,2127
7,8,Ross,"You're right, Phoebe. We've all been under a lot of stress lately.",sadness,2127
8,9,Rachel,I just want us all to be happy and get along.,sadness,2127
9,10,Phoebe,"Then let's start by being kinder to each other, and try to understand where everyone is coming from.",sadness,2127
10,11,Ross,I'll try my best. I just don't want to lose Mona over this.,sadness,2127
11,12,Rachel,"You won't, Ross. I promise I'll do everything I can to fix this.",sadness,2127
12,13,Phoebe,And maybe we can all learn from this and grow stronger together.,sadness,2127
0,1,Rachel,"Mark, what brings you here?",neutral,2128
1,2,Mark,I heard about you and Ross. I just wanted to check in and see how you're doing.,sadness,2128
2,3,Rachel,"Oh, that's... very kind of you. I'm hanging in there, you know, trying to stay positive.",sadness,2128
3,4,Mark,I can't imagine how difficult this must be for you. You and Ross seemed so perfect together.,sadness,2128
4,5,Rachel,"We were. But sometimes even perfect isn't enough, you know?",sadness,2128
5,6,Mark,I do. I've been there myself. It's a tough place to be.,sadness,2128
6,7,Rachel,I just keep wondering if I could have done something differently. If I could have prevented this.,sadness,2128
7,8,Mark,"Rachel, you can't blame yourself. These things happen. It's nobody's fault.",sadness,2128
8,9,Rachel,"I know, logically. But emotionally, it's hard not to.",sadness,2128
9,10,Mark,"I understand. Just remember, you're not alone. You have friends who care about you.",sadness,2128
10,11,Rachel,I know. And I appreciate it. More than you know.,sadness,2128

4,5,Carol,"A while now. I tried to ignore it, but I can't anymore.",sadness,2129

6,7,Carol,I'm saying I want a divorce.,sadness,2129

3,4,Ross,No! Was anyone hurt?,surprise,2130

11,12,Monica,I'll be alright. It just breaks my heart to see something so beautiful destroyed.,sadness,2130
0,1,Rachel,I can't believe they're really gone. It feels like a bad dream.,sadness,2131
1,2,Monica,"I know, I keep expecting them to walk through the door any minute.",sadness,2131
2,3,Phoebe,We did everything we could to stop it. It's not our fault.,sadness,2131
3,4,Ross,"I just feel so helpless. I couldn't save them, and now they're gone forever.",sadness,2131
4,5,Chandler,"We're all here for you, Ross. You're not alone in this.",neutral,2131
5,6,Joey,"Yeah, we'll get through this together. We always do.",sadness,2131

4,5,Monica,I guess you're right. It's just hard to let go of the idea.,sadness,2132
5,6,Rachel,"We all make mistakes, Monica. The important thing is to learn from them.",neutral,2132
6,7,Monica,You're right. I'll try to be more careful in the future.,sadness,2132
7,8,Phoebe,"And maybe next time, we can all research together before buying something like that.",neutral,2132
8,9,Monica,"That's a good idea, Pheebs. Thanks for being so understanding.",sadness,2132
9,10,Rachel,"That's what friends are for, Monica. We're here for you, no matter what.",neutral,2132

2,3,Monica,I guess you're right. But I can't help but feel like everything is changing.,sadness,2133
3,4,Joey,"Well, change isn't always a bad thing. Maybe this is an opportunity for you to meet new people and try new things.",neutral,2133
4,5,Monica,"I suppose. But it's just hard to let go of the past, you know?",sadness,2133
5,6,Joey,"I know it's tough, but sometimes we have to move on. And who knows, maybe you'll find something even better.",neutral,2133

4,5,Phoebe,I miss them so much. We have to make sure we all get together soon.,sadness,2139
5,6,Monica,I agree. Life's too short to not spend time with the people you love.,sadness,2139
6,7,Phoebe,You're right. Let's make a pact to always make time for each other.,sadness,2139

1,2,Ross,"I know how you feel. It's like a never-ending cycle, isn't it?",neutral,2144
2,3,Rachel,It's just so overwhelming sometimes. I miss the days when my mom would do it for me.,sadness,2144
3,4,Ross,I understand. It's hard when we have to take on all these responsibilities ourselves.,sadness,2144
4,5,Rachel,"And it's not just the laundry. It's everything. Cooking, cleaning, bills... It never ends.",sadness,2144
5,6,Ross,"I know it's tough, but we'll get through it. We always do.",neutral,2144

1,2,Ross,"Well, it's not like we've been using it much lately. Besides, I thought you'd be happy to have some extra cash.",neutral,2346
2,3,Chandler,"Yeah, it's not like we're making any profit on it anyway.",anger,2346
3,4,Joey,I still can't believe you spent $300 on that ad!,anger,2346
4,5,Chandler,"It's not like we're getting any calls on it, so it's not like we're losing anything.",anger,2346
5,6,Phoebe,You guys are unbelievable. I can't believe you'd sell something that means so much to us without even asking.,anger,2346
6,7,Ross,"Phoebe, it's just an entertainment center. We can always get another one.",neutral,2346
7,8,Phoebe,"It's not just an entertainment center, it's a part of our home!",anger,2346
8,9,Chandler,"We're not selling it to a museum, it's just going to another person's house.",neutral,2346
9,10,Phoebe,And what if that person doesn't appreciate it like we do?,anger,2346
10,11,Joey,Can we just stop fighting about this and agree to keep the entertainment center?,anger,2346
11,12,Ross,"If it means that much to you guys, then fine. We'll keep it.",neutral,2346
12,13,Chandler,"But if we ever need the money, it's going up on eBay.",anger,2346
0,1,Monica,"Phoebe, have you seen my pie dish? I need it to cover up this awful smell!",anger,2347
1,2,Phoebe,"Monica, I told you already, I don't know where it is. Why are you always blaming me?",anger,2347
2,3,Monica,Because you're always borrowing my stuff and never returning it!,anger,2347
3,4,Phoebe,"Oh my God, Monica, you're so controlling. It's just a pie dish!",anger,2347
4,5,Monica,"Not the point, Phoebe. You need to learn some responsibility.",anger,2347
5,6,Phoebe,"Well, maybe if you didn't try to control everything all the time, people would actually want to help you!",anger,2347
6,7,Monica,I can't believe you right now. I'm done with this conversation.,anger,2347
7,8,Phoebe,"Fine, Monica. Be that way. I'm going to my room.",anger,2347

9,10,Monica,"It's nothing, Joey. Just stay out of it.",anger,2347
10,11,Phoebe,"Yeah, Joey, this is between Monica and me. Thanks for checking in though.",neutral,2347
0,1,Chandler,I can't believe you're actually going through with this!,anger,2348
1,2,Phoebe,Why are you so upset? It's just a name change!,neutral,2348
2,3,Chandler,It's not just a name change! It's a part of who I am!,anger,2348

7,8,Chandler,Fine! I'll do what I want!,anger,2348
8,9,Phoebe,You always do!,anger,2348

7,8,Joey,Good! That's what I wanted!,anger,2350
0,1,Ross,I can't believe you would write me a letter like this!,anger,2351
1,2,Rachel,"I needed to express my feelings, Ross. And this seemed like the best way.",neutral,2351
2,3,Ross,You think a letter is the best way to handle this? After everything we've been through?,anger,2351
3,4,Rachel,I thought it would be easier for both of us. I didn't expect you to get so angry.,sadness,2351
4,5,Ross,"Well, I am angry! You can't just put all of this on paper and expect me to be okay with it!",anger,2351
5,6,Rachel,"I just wanted you to understand how I feel. If we're going to move forward, we need to be honest with each other.",neutral,2351
6,7,Ross,Honest? You think sending me a letter in the middle of the night is being honest?,anger,2351
7,8,Rachel,I didn't send it in the middle of the night. I gave it to you so we could talk about it.,neutral,2351
8,9,Ross,"Well, I don't want to talk about it anymore. I can't believe you would do this to me.",anger,2351
9,10,Rachel,"Ross, please don't be like this. I just wanted us to communicate better.",sadness,2351
10,11,Ross,"Communicate better? By sending me a letter? This isn't communication, Rachel. This is you avoiding a real conversation.",anger,2351
11,12,Rachel,I'm not avoiding anything. I thought this would be the best way to express my feelings.,neutral,2351
12,13,Ross,"Well, you thought wrong. I can't do this right now. I need some time to think.",anger,2351
13,14,Rachel,"Fine, take your time. But I hope you understand that I did this because I care about us.",sadness,2351
14,15,Ross,I don't know what to think right now. I just need to be alone.,anger,2351

1,2,Katie,What is it? You're scaring me!,fear,2352
2,3,Joey,I don't like the way you treat me sometimes. It makes me feel disrespected.,anger,2352
3,4,Katie,What are you talking about? I treat you great!,surprise,2352

5,6,Katie,"Oh, come on, Joey. You're being too sensitive.",disgust,2352
6,7,Joey,"I'm not being too sensitive! I have feelings too, and I don't appreciate being treated like that.",anger,2352
7,8,Katie,"Well, maybe you should just find someone else to date then!",anger,2352
8,9,Joey,Maybe I will!,anger,2352

3,4,Ross,You better not be serious!,anger,2353
4,5,Joey,"Why are you so angry, Ross?",neutral,2353
5,6,Ross,Because I don't want you starting fights!,anger,2353

0,1,Rachel,You really need to learn how to sail if you want to hang out with us this summer.,anger,2355
1,2,Joey,Why are you suddenly so angry about this?,surprise,2355
2,3,Rachel,"Because every time we try to do something fun, you mess it up!",anger,2355
3,4,Phoebe,"Come on, Rachel. It's not that big a deal.",neutral,2355

2,3,Rachel,"Well, that's not our problem! We shouldn't have to suffer because of her negligence.",anger,2357
3,4,Chandler,"I agree, but getting angry won't solve anything.",neutral,2357
4,5,Rachel,You're right. But it's so frustrating! She could at least have the decency to pick up her own cheesecake.,anger,2357
5,6,Chandler,We should just take it and leave a note.,neutral,2357
6,7,Rachel,No way! She doesn't deserve a note. Let her wonder what happened to her precious cheesecake!,anger,2357
7,8,Chandler,"Okay, but we need to do it quickly before she comes back.",fear,2357

8,9,Ross,I can! I just need a minute!,anger,2358
9,10,Phoebe,This is so frustrating!,anger,2358

3,4,Phoebe,"I know, and I feel terrible about it. But this new ring is even better!",anger,2359
4,5,Chandler,"It's not about the ring, Phoebe! It's about the fact that you didn't do what I asked!",anger,2359
5,6,Phoebe,"Chandler, I made a mistake. What more do you want me to say?",anger,2359
6,7,Chandler,I want you to understand how important this was to me!,anger,2359

4,5,Ross,"Joey, this is not helping!",anger,2361
5,6,Monica,"Ross, I know this is difficult, but getting angry won't solve anything.",neutral,2361
6,7,Ross,"You're right, I shouldn't be angry. I should be furious!",anger,2361
7,8,Phoebe,But anger will only push her away. You need to talk to her and understand her feelings.,neutral,2361
8,9,Ross,Her feelings? What about my feelings?,anger,2361
9,10,Monica,"Of course your feelings matter, but so do hers. You need to find a way to work through this together.",neutral,2361

3,4,Joey,I don't care about the ingredients! I can't wear food on my head!,anger,2362
4,5,Monica,You specifically asked for unique hat designs!,anger,2362
5,6,Joey,"Not like this! I wanted stylish, not ridiculous!",anger,2362
6,7,Monica,"I'm not a miracle worker, Joey!",anger,2362
7,8,Joey,You're supposed to be a designer!,anger,2362

11,12,Phoebe,Oh no! You guys aren't supposed to get divorced for 7 years!,surprise,2365

3,4,Chandler,"To express yourself, to create something delicious, not just to get people to like you.",neutral,2379
4,5,Monica,"Well, maybe I like making people happy with my food!",anger,2379
5,6,Chandler,"There's nothing wrong with that, but it shouldn't be the only reason.",neutral,2379
6,7,Monica,"You know what, Chandler? Maybe you should stop trying to analyze my motives and just enjoy the fact that I'm good at something!",anger,2379

4,5,Joey,Whatever. I thought we were all going to the movies together. Now you're bailing on us too?,anger,2395
5,6,Monica,I'm just going to stop by the New School first. It won't take long. I want that food critic to try my bouillabaisse again.,neutral,2395
6,7,Joey,You're obsessed with that guy's opinion. Who cares what he thinks?,anger,2395

8,9,Joey,Funny? You thought it would be funny to go on a gay cruise without telling me?,anger,2397
9,10,Chandler,I didn't think you'd care!,anger,2397
10,11,Joey,"Well, I do care! And now I know I can't trust you!",anger,2397
0,1,Rachel,I can't believe Ross had the nerve to say that to me!,anger,2398
