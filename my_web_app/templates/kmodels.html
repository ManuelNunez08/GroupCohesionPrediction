            for an arbitrary two minute segment. For example, a given point might represent the list [3,4,3]. <br><br>

            Each point is plotted in reference to its average and standard deviation. The standard deviation of a point
            should be used to interpret
            aggreeability amongst annotators. To establish a robust ground truth, points used to train the model should
            have a low standard deviation
            to assure that an acceptable degree of consensus exist.The average of a point is used to gauge the degree of
            cohesion noted, on average, by
            the three annotators. Since a binary classification model was chosen, points must be partitioned into high
            and low cohesion groups to assign a binary labels to each observation.<br><br>

            Please set a Standard Deviation and Average Score contraints keeping in mind that a good training dataset
            will
            balance annotator consensus, partition distance, and number of observations. Continue with your model build
