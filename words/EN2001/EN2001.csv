27.02,27.44,E,. Hmm ?,EN2001a
28.09,39.03,A,"Like duplication of effort and stuff , and um yeah , he was saying that we should maybe uh think about having a prototype for week six , which is next",EN2001a
38.78,39.11,D,Next,EN2001a
39.03,39.62,A,week,EN2001a
39.11,39.41,D,week .,EN2001a
39.62,47.46,A,. Yeah . So we should probably prioritize our packages,EN2001a

47.46,47.46,A,.,EN2001a

56.89,56.89,A,.,EN2001a
56.89,79.04,E,"we don't have pre-annotated write like a stupid baseline , then we should probably be able to basically that means we focus on on the interface first sort of , so that we we take the the ready-made parts and just see how we get them work together in the interface the way we want and and then we have a working prototype . And then we can go back and replace pieces either by our own components or by more sophisticated compo po components of our own . So it's probably",EN2001a

110.34,121.94,E,"that , uh probably like after today's meeting , we then actually need to well go back first of all and look at NITE X_M_L_ to see in how far that that which we want is compatible with that which NITE X_M_L_ offers us . And",EN2001a
121.94,122.14,A,Yeah,EN2001a

122.16,156.19,E,"just sort of everyone make sure everyone understand the interface . So I think if today we decide on what data we wanna have now , and and later , maybe even today , we go and look at NITE X_M_L_ or some of us look at NITE X_M_L_ in a bit more detail , just trying to make some sense of that code and see how does the representation work in their system . And then sort of with that knowledge we should be able to then say okay , that type of NITE X_M_L_ data we wanna load into it , and this is how everyone can access it , and then",EN2001a

161.69,161.69,A,.,EN2001a
161.8,187.1,E,"looked looked at the documentation and n like seen enough to make me think that we want to use the NITE X_M_L_ framework because um they have a good a event model that synchronizes sort of the data and and every display element . So that takes a lot of work away from us . Sort of that would be a reason for staying within their framework and using their general classes . But beyond that I haven't looked at it at all , which is something we should really do",EN2001a
186.8,187.18,A,Yeah,EN2001a

187.99,197.57,E,"for this whole discussion I mean , who of us is doing stuff that is happening on-line and who of us is doing stuff that's happening off-line ? Like my data is coming c",EN2001a
210.58,210.74,E,Hmm ?,EN2001a
211.33,213.43,C,The basic word importance is off-line,EN2001a
213.16,213.63,E,Yeah,EN2001a

218.86,218.86,E,.,EN2001a
218.96,220.58,C,has typed in into the search .,EN2001a
221.0,221.49,E,Okay .,EN2001a
222.11,229.35,D,Uh mine's gonna be mostly using the off-line . But the actual stuff it's doing will be on-line . But it won't be very,EN2001a

229.35,231.88,D,"um processor intensive or memory intensive , I don't",EN2001a
231.74,232.74,E,So,EN2001a
231.88,232.21,D,think .,EN2001a
232.74,252.38,E,"basically apart from the display module , the i the display itself , we don't have an extremely high degree of interaction between sort of our modules that create the stuff and and the interface , so the interface is mainly while it's running just working on data that's just loaded from a file , I guess . There",EN2001a
252.27,252.47,A,Yeah,EN2001a
252.38,252.73,E,isn't,EN2001a
252.47,253.2,A,", I I don't know about",EN2001a
253.03,253.5,B,Hmm,EN2001a
253.2,253.72,A,the search,EN2001a

253.72,257.5,A,"functionality , that might be online . Depends how it's gonna work .",EN2001a
257.88,265.85,E,"Yeah , I know . Th Yeah , the search is I guess the search is sort of a strange beast anyway because for the search we're leaving the NITE X_M_L_ framework",EN2001a
265.84,266.2,A,Yeah,EN2001a
265.85,268.19,E,. Um,EN2001a
266.2,266.2,A,.,EN2001a
268.19,293.12,E,but that's still sort of that's good . That means that at least like we don't have the type of situation where somebody has to do like a billion calculations on on data on-line . 'Cause that would make it a lot more like that would mean that our interface for the data would have to be a lot more careful about how it performs and and everything . And nobody is modifying that data at at on-line time at all it seems . Nobody's making any changes to the actual data on-line .,EN2001a
294.86,295.53,D,Don't think so .,EN2001a
295.65,297.6,E,So that's actually making it a lot easier . That basically,EN2001a
297.33,297.64,D,Yeah,EN2001a
297.6,297.75,E,means,EN2001a
297.64,297.64,D,.,EN2001a
297.75,306.14,E,"our browser really is a viewer mostly , which isn't doing much with the data except for sort of selecting a piece piece of it and and displaying it .",EN2001a
310.94,313.59,D,Are we still gonna go for dumping it into a database,EN2001a
313.4,313.58,E,Hmm ?,EN2001a
313.59,315.6,D,? Are we still gonna dump it into a database ?,EN2001a
316.12,319.83,E,"Well some parts relevant for the search , yes . I'd say so .",EN2001a
320.21,325.29,D,"'Cause if we are , I reckon we should all read our classes out of the database . It'll be so much easier .",EN2001a
325.84,326.08,E,Hmm ?,EN2001a
326.69,342.02,D,"Well if we're gonna dump the part of it into a database anyway , we might as well dump all the fields we want into the database , calculate everything from there . Then we don't even have to worry that much about the underlying X_M_L_ representation . We can just query it .",EN2001a
343.38,392.85,E,"Yeah , but nobody of us is doing much of searching from the data in the on-line stage . And for all together , like the display itself , I think we are easier if we if it's sitting on the X_M_L_ than if it's sitting on the S_Q_L_ stuff , because if it's sitting on the X_M_L_ , we have the the NITE X_M_L_ framework with all its functionality for synchronizing through all the different levels whenever there's a change , whenever something's moving forward and stuff . And we can just more or less look at their code , like how their player moves forward , and how that moving forward is represented in different windows and stuff . So I think in the actual browser itself I don't wanna sit on the S_Q_L_ if we can sit on the X_M_L_ because sitting on the X_M_L_ we have all we have so much help . And for y for like the p the calculations that we're doing apart from the search , it seems that everyone needs some special representations anyway .",EN2001a
393.66,398.87,D,"Well if we're gonna do that , we should try and store everything in in an X_M_L_ format as well .",EN2001a
400.12,401.65,E,You mean our results,EN2001a
401.19,401.52,D,Yeah .,EN2001a
401.65,406.55,E,"? Yeah , in in the NITE X_M_L_ X_M_L_ format , so with their time stamps and stuff , so that it's easy",EN2001a

408.56,408.56,D,.,EN2001a
411.68,461.86,E,"What I'm like what we have to think about is if we go with this multi-level idea , like this idea that sort of if you start with a whole meeting series as one entity , as one thing that you display , as one whole sort of , that then the individual chunks of the individual meetings , whereas and then you can click on a meeting , and then sort of the meeting is the whole thing and the chunks are the individual segments , that means sort of we have multiple levels of of representation , which we probably If we if we do it this way like we f we have to discuss that if we do it this way , then we should probably find some abstraction model , so that the interface in the sense like deals with it as if it's same so that the interface doesn't really have to worry whether it's a meeting in the whole meeting series or a segment within a meeting , you know what I mean",EN2001a

3848.24,3855.24,E,That's not really what I meant . But I think I have to think more about what I meant . Um g I'm confused about everything .,EN2001a
3856.98,3869.62,D,So basically what you're saying is you can take an arbitrary amount of data and process it with the same algorithm . It doesn't matter conceptually what that data is . It could be a meeting . it could be two utterances . it could,EN2001a
3869.59,3870.11,E,Yeah,EN2001a

3904.71,3932.13,D,"I don't think it's very difficult though . I mean what you do is you just build an X_M_L_ file , and if you want it to get down to the utterances , you'd go to the leaves .
