80.71,80.71,D,.,IN1002.
82.12,486.06,B,". Okay , so it's uh my g work is generally about uh using posteriors in uh speech recognition systems and uh somehow enhancing the estimation of posteriors , getting new posteriors which are havi which are more informative by somehow integrating some extra knowledge like uh prior knowledge and contextual information related to the problem and then use this posterior estimation uh uh method uh for designing hierarchical uh speech recognition system . So in this hierarchical arg architecture I will be able to uh integrate the extra knowledge at the proper level of hierarchy , and I will be al also uh able to uh combine different kind of uh knowledge or sources uh sources of knowledge I have . Uh well as you know uh generally posteriors are estimated using uh neural networks and more specifically M_L_P_s in a speech recognition system , so uh time limited window of a speech signal is uh represented by some cepstral features , which are then processed by an M_L_P_ and it gives us some evidence as in the form of pos phone posteriors . Then we use these phone posteriors as features or as scores for for either just decoding or d uh uh n d training and inference training and then decoding . Uh but we know that uh in this uh in this case we are not able to integrate contextual information uh uh line contextual information , and we are not able to integrate the prior knowledge we can have about phone use or about uh words in the posterior estimation , so the main motivation is to see if we can integrate this kind of extra knowledge in the posterior estimation . So what is proposed to solve this problem is to use a uh what we formally use in H_M_M_ formalism , which is called gamma uh state posterior . Uh i uh as a posterior for uh training uh or decoding , so it's uh well as you know it's a state posterior probablility in a H_M_M_ , which is defined as the probability of being in a specific H_M_M_ state at a specific time , having the whole observation sequence and the model . So whole observation sequence means having complete contextual information and the mod uh and the model can encode some kind of prior knowledge for us by means of uh topological constraints . Uh well you know it's uh this gam uh gamma posterior is written in terms of forward and backward H_M_M_ recursions , and actually one way to use this uh gamma posteriors is uh using these posteriors as some kind of newer scores for decoding . So in this case it will be uh similar to hybrid method . Um the the difference is that we do one more step , uh maybe I can explain it better there . So we do one more step here , and we uh here by means of another H_M_M_ we introduce some kind of uh prior knowledge and contextual information , we get better evidences than what i we initially had here , and then we do the uh decoding and the and s more informative posteriors uh uh instead of this one . So we are expecting to uh the system to perform better and more robust to noisy cases . Here you see uh some results uh and how uh how what is the effect of introducing uh reasonable prior knowledge , so different uh rows in this table are showing different level of noise and also clean speech , and different columns are showing different kind of posteriors or gamma posteriors . So uh the the first column is showing the uh our baseline system , which is getting estimate of posteriors out of M_L_P_ uh and then d using these posteriors for decoding . And the other columns are showing the performance of uh different kind of gamma , so uh gamma which is estimated using uh information about minimum duration of phonemes , about possible transition between phonemes and some kind some uh more prior knowledge like uh which wo like uh which word is composed of which phonemes and uh g uh gram grammatical knowledge ab uh about transition between words and things like this . So as you see , introducing more reasonable prior knowledge um will h help to have better performance in almo in almost all the cases . And here I compare the performance of the gamma base system with the standard H_M_M_ G_M_M_ system , which is based on uh doing decoding uh using uh likelihood as the scores , and the difference is that our system use uh is using posteriors for decoding , so as you see s uh it's working uh better than the standard H_M_M_ G_M_M_ system . And finally the conclusion is uh he here we saw how we can get uh some more informative posteriors by introducing extra knowledge like prior and contextual information , and then using this uh uh p posterior estimation method to design hierarchical uh speech recognition system which we're which which the goal is to have a better , more efficient and more robust system . So if you want now we can discuss about um uh the crash and the loss of data , so uh well I lost all the posteriors I was I uh I used as input uh for my system , so the gamma are somehow estimated or computed on top of posteriors . And now I don't have any posterior and uh probably the scripts generating that posterior , so what I can do okay .",IN1002.
