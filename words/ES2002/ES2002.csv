Um so I've tried to take a whole lot of market research and summarise it for us , and then ide identify uh trends that are are sort of in sync and are important to our our uh p project plan that we have so far , and then uh initiate a kind of discussion on design options so that it sorta helps us to to narrow in on on aspects that will inform other uh other elements of the of the project .

241.37,259.27,D,". Okay so out of um different uh figures and ratings ob uh of people in general , um consumers in general , the number one thing that was found was that uh the br t television remote control , a fancy look and feel , okay , and not , it specified , not a functional look or or feel",ES2002c
258.92,259.36,B,Okay,ES2002c

259.54,308.11,D,"b f f fancy . Um however , this is where we kinda have to be very , I think , creative about it . Number two was that it be innovative . Okay so that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative without a adding just unnecessary um sort of functional bits to it . Uh and third priority uh for ease of use , so again that kind of gives us a general picture of how it has to be , um quite user friendly while still having technology . So it I'll just say right away as a bit of a foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of m marketing , is that I think um what we should think about is how the um about how the innovation uh contributes to the look and feel , and not so much to the functionality of it . For example",ES2002c
307.62,308.39,B,Aye right,ES2002c
308.11,308.53,D,like,ES2002c
308.39,308.39,B,.,ES2002c
308.53,314.18,D,"when you pick it up and push it like it all lights up or something , you know what I mean , like , or it's got something else to it",ES2002c
313.97,314.37,B,Uh-huh,ES2002c
314.18,314.53,D,that just,ES2002c
314.37,314.37,B,.,ES2002c
314.53,325.82,D,seems innovative because obviously the thing that the message here is ease of use . So how do you make innovation make something more more easy to use ? Well that's I guess where we're gonna go with this,ES2002c
325.01,325.47,B,Okay .,ES2002c
325.82,355.89,D,". Okay then there's the other aspect of the back the the market um research I have here is on fashion style , okay , which as we've agreed is a priority . Uh top European fashion trend um that I read about says there's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables , okay , especially in clothes and furniture . And when I first saw that I thought hmm , well do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it , or we get right into it , or we completely steer away from it , do you know what I",ES2002c
355.89,356.43,B,Okay,ES2002c
355.89,356.15,D,mean ?,ES2002c
356.43,356.8,B,okay,ES2002c
356.72,356.81,D,So,ES2002c
356.8,356.8,B,.,ES2002c
356.81,441.97,D,"my my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend , but we want to think also about the fact that it sort of has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics . Um 'cause I think what we're in what we're in is partly sort of home decor , partly something like a computer , um so I think we might wanna be careful about how you know how quickly we create like a remote control in the shape of an apple or something , I think that would be pushing it . And then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and sort of , you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle , which is which also in indicated that last year this was this was not the case . So um probably a lot of the competition on the market will be still in last year's mode , so if we try and really capitalise on that , I think that'll be in our favour . Um So these this is the summary of everything . Um style is number one uh thing in the in the market of who we're selling to . Uh innovative design technology's also a must in that it's seen it'd be seen to be uh cutting edge , uh but ease of use t has to be insured throughout . That was like the number three thing . And then at the end there are vibrant natural colours um that's the way I interpreted it anyway , softness in materials , shape , and function , and so I've written at written at the bottom to give us sort of a context of discussion , Mac iPods",ES2002c

442.37,449.68,D,"which is , I'd have to say very high-tech , ten gigabytes , whatever , but when you hold it in your hand there's like no buttons . You know",ES2002c
449.57,449.89,B,Mm,ES2002c
449.68,450.07,D,what a Mac,ES2002c

451.03,451.32,B,", yeah",ES2002c
451.04,451.49,D,I'm thinking,ES2002c
451.32,451.32,B,.,ES2002c
451.49,524.97,D,"however Mac iPod is sort of last year's because it's very hard and sort of glassy and glossy , so I'm thinking if we imagine that we're taking some of the features of a Mac iPod and we're then making it s more of like a more of like a comfortable type of or more of like a maybe more vibrant to friendly thing to have . Um and then so this is w with all that information what I'm what I'm suggesting in this slide here is that we we take these ideas , and as we get into more the more um techni like sort of production side of things , that we think about shape , materials , and themes or series that go throughout . Sort of like a I dunno like um we think of some kind of a thin theme that unifies it all , that we agree on , uh sorta like a marketing identity . Um Does that make sense ? Yeah . So so like I threw out a few ideas there just to kinda get us thinking along those lines like lemon , lime , I dunno , green colours , pe whatever , it's just an idea , 'cause I'm thinking that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their what people associate this them with in terms of texture , shape , colours , things like that .",ES2002c

548.66,549.01,B,Yeah .,ES2002c
549.07,563.65,D,I'm thinking maybe we could incorporate some of these features into a fairly um into something which is which seems to have something to it which is almost gimmicky because like um like something to do with like lighting within it . Like you know just within,ES2002c
