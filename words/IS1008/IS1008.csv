And I have come up with the management come with the new proposal , okay , and I have to discuss a few points on this . Uh both says new insights in the aim of your project . Uh the one is uh the teletext becomes uh outmoded , okay because if uh because of the computer systems and the new technology . So we don't need to consider really about the teletext all in our new project design . And the second one is about uh the remote control . Should be used only for the T_V_ .

So um well I I figured uh we should um identify some user requirements , and from my experience , I wanna uh , and from research I did , uh the the device has to turn the television on and off the first time you press on the big button , you can't uh can't have like uh waffling on this point , you know . Really have It needs to be able y y have to be able to find it . Because one of the biggest problems with remote controls is finding them . So uh , I also , since we have to establish our corporate image on the basis of this new product , thought we better look at things that are popular and um ex go beyond those , and , as I said in the first meeting , um and then uh we might wanna talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in uh in the construction , especially in the the uh the outside of the product so that it gives the appearance , and it is reliable , and so forth . I did a little history on uh the the uh remote controls and when they were invented and so forth , so , I guess this guy Zenith uh created the Flashmatic , which I kinda like the idea , 'cause it made me think of um um maybe the remote control made a big flash when uh you turn the T_V_ on and off , that might be interesting . And um so it was highly directional flash light that uh you could turn the picture on and off , and the sound on and off , and change channels c so I think um those are still requirements we have today , uh",IS1008b

347.19,454.2,B,"something to keep in mind . It'd be easy to find . And um it would uh y you'd you could throw it at things if if the T_V_ didn't turn on and off , you could use it for something else . And since I'm not really um Industrial Designer , I didn't really know what to do with this slide . But um I just took some different uh schematics and I put them into this , and I guess this is what a slide might look like if you were drawing a circuit board . I don't know why um we were asked to do this . So , uh personal preferences , um I think we could uh I I'm really thinking outside the box here , and I think that we should consider perhaps having an an an a a size uh a remote control that changes in size depending on the user preference . So something that's very very flexible and inflatable and then you could shrink it . I think um it could either be you could go either one extreme , be very colourful , or you could make it clear , and um kind of blend in with things , so you didn't have to um uh have a problem with the th the decoration of the of the user's home . Um I think uh it needs to be waterproof , because uh sometimes they fall into cups and , you know , it might be out by the swimming pool or something like that . Um if you uh mi one of one of my requirements was about needs t to tell you when it's done its job or not , because half the time , I keep pushing on the remote control , and I don't know if it's actually understood my message , so I think it should give you some sort of an oral cue . And uh , course I never wanna replace the battery . So , that's those are my f preferences , and that's my presentation .",IS1008b

1325.04,1477.19,C,". Yeah , and that's fine . Okay . So , basically , the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like and what people don't like about existing products . So , in our case , existing remote controls . And then , what the good ideas are , and what the bad ideas are , and why they're bad and good , which isn't always as obvious . We seem to have intuitions about why things are good or things are bad , but when you look , technically , at how it works , sometimes that's not the case . Then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep , 'cause that'll feed into both Ed's work and Christine's work . Um and then what the remote control should look like , obviously , once we've got a good idea of what the functionalities are . So , in terms of the functionalities that we need , you obviously need to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off . You need to change channels , both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing . You need to be able to control the volume and then control any menus on the T_V_ to regulate contrast or whatever . So , the problems that people have expressed is that there's too many buttons on remote controls , in general . The buttons it's not clear what they're supposed to do . Um often , you need to know specific button sequences to get certain functionalities done , um which you don't necessarily always remember , especially if it's a functionality that you don't use very often . And that the buttons are too small . So , here we've got two examples where here on the left-hand side , you can see a remote control that has lots and lots of buttons . The buttons , in a lot of cases , are tiny . Um they're hard to see , and okay , they're labelled , but the labels don't necessarily tell you too much . Whereas , on the other side , you have a much simpler remote control that I think basically has the minimum functionalities that are needed . And it sort of looks simpler and just less imposing when you first look at it . So , I would be inclined to go sort of towards this , in terms of design , rather than this . And if there's specific functionalities that require more buttons , then we can figure out how to do it with existing um buttons . So my personal preferences are to keep the number of buttons to a limit , or to a minimum , sorry , make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed , so like the on button being really obvious one , the channel changing and the volume , and to keep the design basically sleek",IS1008b

Um so the other w thing that we So . Our method for going about this is we've looked at uh the histo hi historical record , what's worked , what hasn't and then we also um we wanted to evaluate some new materials and we contacted manufacturing for their input because , course , we m might come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technologies or capabilities to offer us , so uh this is the approach that we took during our um our research . So um for the case , um we told we were making a specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design . Course , you know , I wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable , but um that uh doesn't seem to b be one of the choic non-option we can uh we can really seriously explore , so then we were thinking about um rubber , but um unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat uh factor and th um there might be some problems with the m uh how it's uh goes with the board . Uh and uh then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle it gets brittle after a while , so um we still had titanium and and wood available , but um unfortunately uh uh titanium's also been eliminated uh , the m people in manufacturing said that you couldn't make d curved cases out of titanium , although how Apple did it with th PowerBook I'm not su quite sure but uh nevertheless um they've eliminated all of our options except wood .

298.13,415.73,C,"uh material , so we're we're currently uh proposing , uh we'll get to all my personal preferences in just a second . So then there's this other matter of the chips and um well we could use a simple design on the board , but uh these simple chips , but that's only works for the bu you don't get very much um intelligence with this simple one . And um then there was the regular which I regret that I've forgotten exactly why I'm eliminating that one . Uh the other option was this advanced chip on print , and uh we liked th we we found that it it includes this infrared sender , which w 'member the beam was that was an important component of finding the right chip . And uh manufacturing has told us that they've um uh recently developed a uh a sensor and a speaker that would uh be integrated into this advanced chip on print , so uh we we uh now jumping right to our personal preferences um I I'd really think we should , you know , use some of uh some really exotic woods , like um , you know uh , well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods . I think that people will might really want to design their own cases , you see , they could do sort of a this um three-dimensional design on the internet , and then they could submit their orders , kinda like you submit a custom car order , you know , and you can choose the colour and the size of the wheels and the colours of the leather and things like that , and then I uh think we should go with the solar cells as well as the um microphone and speaker on the advanced chip . So this is the findings of our research and my recommendations um for the new remote control w um would be to have um have it be made out of wood . Do you have any problems with that ?",IS1008c

You'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big , sort of in the corner and by itself , so you don't accidentally turn your T_V_ off while you're trying to manoeuvre other buttons . And then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for , oops , channels and volume , sort of for surfing channels and then volume , so the volume would be the up and down , 'cause volume goes up and down and then channels left to right .

142.79,143.1,A,Yes .,IS1008d
143.28,245.65,C,"? Thanks . Alright , so from when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting , we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape , the material that we chose was wood , and uh the colour would be customisable , 'cause you can stain the wood whatever colour . Um , so in terms of function , you have to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off , volume and channel control , menu control , voice recognition control , and we've incorporated the L_C_D_ screen on the flip panel as part of the design , if we figure out it's too expensive , well then you just take it off . Um , so to unveil our lovely product . This is our remote control , with the flip panel as you can see . So if you lift up the panel , you can see the lovely yellow L_C_D_ display . Um , this is actually hard to do . The yellow button you have is the on off button , so it's really big , hard to miss . You have the the red um triangles are the toggles for changing the volume . So up volume up , down volume down . The green are the channel changing . S And it's one of those very light , very touchable displays . And then you have the numeric pad in the dark blue at the bottom , and on the right-hand side you have the access to the menu on the T_V_ , and on the left-hand side you have the the the ability to turn off the voice recognition . So this is pretty much what we had on the white board the last time .",IS1008d

253.4,253.48,B,d,IS1008d
253.72,265.34,C,feature on the back is that you can have your own customised backing and I suppose you could do the same thing on the flip case on the front . So that you can really make this a highly highly customisable remote control .,IS1008d
266.28,280.08,B,We haven't um uh specified where the speaker or the microphone will be placed . That depends on the uh s design of the circuit board inside and uh what room is left um,IS1008d
