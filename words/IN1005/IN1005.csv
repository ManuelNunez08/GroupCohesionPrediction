32.88,35.05,D,So is it correct or no ?,IN1005.
35.89,36.25,A,Oops .,IN1005.
36.75,39.45,B,You never know whether you've got these things on right or not,IN1005.
38.88,39.11,D,Hmm ?,IN1005.
39.45,41.72,B,. You never know whether they're on right or not,IN1005.
41.24,42.94,D,Yeah,IN1005.
41.72,41.72,B,.,IN1005.
41.87,42.12,C,Yeah .,IN1005.
42.94,44.19,D,". Well , so we hope .",IN1005.
44.43,53.91,B,"Feels wrong . Okay , so I don't need that . Okay",IN1005.
53.35,53.87,C,Okay .,IN1005.
53.91,63.47,B,. So David came in to me and to say uh i something we'd been talking about for a while was some stuff I'd been working on about using these topic models,IN1005.
63.03,63.31,A,Mm-hmm,IN1005.
63.13,63.37,D,Mm-hmm,IN1005.
63.31,63.31,A,.,IN1005.
63.37,63.37,D,.,IN1005.
63.47,70.54,B,"with uh with networks , with n things with links between them , documents that are linked . Uh",IN1005.
70.31,71.07,A,The rapple,IN1005.
70.54,71.82,B,n,IN1005.
71.07,71.86,A,also,IN1005.
71.82,72.05,B,uh,IN1005.
71.86,72.48,A,. No,IN1005.
72.05,72.66,B,it's actually,IN1005.
72.48,72.48,A,.,IN1005.
72.66,82.28,B,"it's related to rapple , but it's not actually that th this is something I haven't actually been working on for a couple of months now , uh just because I came up with something more interesting",IN1005.
82.08,83.23,A,Okay,IN1005.
82.28,83.62,B,"that I've been working on , but",IN1005.
83.23,83.23,A,.,IN1005.
83.62,97.93,B,"uh th at the time basically I'd been trying to use P_L_S_A_ and those types of models on web pages , and that came up with uh a big problem in that most web pages have very very little text on them .",IN1005.
98.11,98.33,D,Mm-hmm .,IN1005.
98.52,116.17,B,"But you can tell what they're about based on the other texts on the site , the texts on the things they're linked to , so what I wanted to know was can you combine the topic models that the pages , that have lots of text on them , with something else that that tells you what a page that has no or very little text on it",IN1005.
115.36,116.18,A,Mm-hmm . With,IN1005.
116.17,116.74,B,based,IN1005.
116.18,117.05,A,the link here,IN1005.
116.74,117.27,B,on the links,IN1005.
117.05,117.36,A,in,IN1005.
117.27,117.54,B,", yeah",IN1005.
117.36,117.36,A,.,IN1005.
117.54,135.21,B,". So quite simply if you have a page one which is like a home page , and that'll maybe have five links and a picture on it , and then because it links to page two and page three . Can you tell what this is about",IN1005.
135.05,135.25,D,Yeah,IN1005.
135.21,135.21,B,?,IN1005.
135.25,135.25,D,.,IN1005.
135.32,135.42,A,Mm-hmm .,IN1005.
135.56,168.32,B,"Yeah , so I started looking at uh Google page rank , which kinda does this by saying well , the links go the other way , it says if this page is about fish or in Google , they say if this page is good in some way , and it links to this other page , and we don't know what this is , then that page is more likely to be good . And it's just page rank is just a simple algorithm for doing this over the whole big network . So I wanted to combine the topic models that tell you beforehand what you think this page and this page are about",IN1005.
167.71,167.99,A,Mm-hmm .,IN1005.
168.32,216.19,B,"with this to maybe get a better idea . So the idea is say you've got some text on a page , that's only part of the picture about what of what the page is really about , and the links pointing to that page are also part of the picture . So I basically came up with an algorithm that's just a i it plugs P_L_S_A_ uh plugs page rank into P_L_S_A_ , right , so page rank you basically just d uh say You basically take the how good this page is , which is X_ , and how good this page is , which is Y_ , and you then say this page is based on uh how do you do this ? Based on the the links coming into it",IN1005.
215.77,216.06,A,Mm-hmm .,IN1005.
216.19,226.38,B,", uh it's just a like a sum over all the the links of uh well , X_ link I guess",IN1005.
225.54,226.69,A,"Of the value , yeah",IN1005.
226.38,226.71,B,. O of,IN1005.
226.69,227.21,A,", mm-hmm",IN1005.
226.71,227.43,B,of the value,IN1005.
227.21,228.14,A,. Mm,IN1005.
227.43,228.25,B,. Uh uh the but it's,IN1005.

234.58,234.87,A,Okay .,IN1005.
234.97,249.96,B,", page rank of Y_ . I think this is roughly it off hand . Page rank of Z_ . So you say page rank of Z_ is equal to uh one over a constant to normalise",IN1005.
249.59,250.12,A,Mm-hmm,IN1005.
249.96,251.12,B,it,IN1005.
250.12,250.12,A,.,IN1005.
251.12,258.53,B,. Uh sum over all the links into Z_ of page rank of the link,IN1005.
258.12,258.31,A,Mm-hmm .,IN1005.
258.53,279.39,B,". Yeah , tha it's like that , yeah ? So similar idea . If you got a vector that says what the topics are , say you've learned from P_L_S_A_ a d a distribution of topics for every page , so if you say a probability of topic one for uh for page uh Z_",IN1005.
279.31,279.59,A,Mm-hmm .,IN1005.
281.03,304.4,B,"uh is equal to , and you can use the same sort of thing . Right , so nicking a whole bunch of maths from how you work out page rank , uh it comes up with uh just uh an iterative algorithm , which is just uh the current probability of topic one given Z_ , so that's probability old plus uh",IN1005.
306.12,306.46,C,Okay,IN1005.
306.42,306.57,B,i,IN1005.
306.46,306.46,C,.,IN1005.
306.57,312.88,B,"yeah , plus that and then you normalise between them , so you say alpha and one minus alpha . Yeah",IN1005.
312.03,312.26,C,Okay .,IN1005.
312.88,329.47,B,". So w basically what you're saying here , one minus alpha say link contribution you can call this I guess . So what you're saying is that a page is partly from its text that you've got on the page , and it's partly from what the links say it's about . So that alpha thing is how much do you trust the text on",IN1005.
329.38,329.89,A,Uh-huh,IN1005.
329.47,329.93,B,the page,IN1005.
329.89,329.89,A,.,IN1005.
329.93,333.12,B,", and how much do you trust the links . So that alpha could be different for every page .",IN1005.
333.32,334.95,A,Mm,IN1005.
334.8,336.31,B,So,IN1005.
334.95,335.51,A,. Okay .,IN1005.
336.31,346.42,B,"what I did then was try this on a big database of web pages . Uh and I had some results from that , but they were all on temp two , so that's not important right now . Uh",IN1005.
345.55,346.07,D,Mm-hmm .,IN1005.
346.42,371.81,B,"but as it is not really important , I can regenerate that . The problem was that this gives you a new vector of topics for every page . So you've got two vectors , you've got the one that you've just got from P_L_S_A_ or whatever model , and you've got the one that you get from this . Uh how do you tell which one's better ? I had no way to evaluate this well . How do you tell that this page because you don't know where the topics are , 'cause they're",IN1005.

402.3,402.51,A,Okay,IN1005.

402.51,402.51,A,.,IN1005.
402.55,406.37,C,you you should first train the P_L_S_A_ stuff,IN1005.
405.94,406.32,B,Yeah .,IN1005.
406.37,410.53,C,", then you initialise this link uh spreading thing",IN1005.
410.23,411.71,B,Mm-hmm,IN1005.
410.53,412.13,C,", and then you iterate over",IN1005.
411.71,412.55,B,". That's it , exactly",IN1005.
412.13,412.88,C,okay,IN1005.
412.55,412.75,B,", yeah .",IN1005.
412.88,420.87,C,. And it converge and so you have the boost uh initial P_L_S_A_ and P_L_S_A_ plus the link thing,IN1005.
420.74,421.26,B,Exactly,IN1005.
420.87,421.18,C,then .,IN1005.
421.26,430.04,B,", yeah , so you've now got you've got P_L_S_A_ gives you two probabilities , right ? So it gives you a probability of a topic given a document",IN1005.
429.9,430.09,C,Yeah,IN1005.
430.04,430.17,B,", which",IN1005.
430.09,430.09,C,.,IN1005.

435.96,436.12,C,Mm .,IN1005.

Alright , well that's for for every word and that's once for the document and that's you've got a parameter coming at this globally . So that that's roughly what the model is , plus other little bits . But anyway , so what they did was they they reworked this because one of the problems with L_D_A_ , and I think P_L_S_A_ has this problem as well in is that uh the more topics you have , the less uh expressive it can be , because the topics it cluster it it pushes a document if it is pulling a document into one topic , it pushes another topic away from that",IN1005.

So you can have as many as you like , uh and you can tell that they're close to each other , so there's load of ideas that I had about this uh in that if you can tell that two topic distributions are close to each other . So for example if you split a document into two parts and said that the two parts have to be close in the distribution , you can see how the doc t the document changes , for exa stu stuff based on that . With this idea , what if rather than working with this P_ of Z_ given D_ thing that you had from P_L_S_A_ , but what if you worked from these Gaussians that you get for every document and you said that in some some function that said uh that the Gaussian representing this should be similar to the ones linking to it . Now I haven't thought about any of the maths for this , but but it should be uh straightforward I guess to to formulate a basic in terms of the mean should be similar and the covariance maybe should be similar as well .
