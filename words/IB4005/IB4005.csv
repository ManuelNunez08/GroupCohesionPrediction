0.02,9.97,A,"Uh I guess I start with my presentation . We had two groups of people working on this . So we'll show you two slightly different presentations . Feel free to ask any questions or comments , obviously",IB4005.
9.86,10.23,B,Okay,IB4005.
9.97,10.73,A,. Um,IB4005.
10.23,10.23,B,.,IB4005.
10.73,27.45,A,"the first one was done by myself , Bruno , Marianne and Nikos . And the rationale that we have , I'll show you the layout in a second , was that full professors would get private offices . Administration is close to the professors offices , so it's easier for the secretary to speak to everyone",IB4005.
27.16,27.59,B,Mm-hmm,IB4005.
27.45,27.91,A,. The fax,IB4005.
27.59,27.59,B,.,IB4005.
27.91,78.56,A,"is in the administration office , since it's mostly used by Gisella , who's the secretary . For noise reduction purposes we've moved everyone who has office hours together , and we've also put the network printer and the photocopier in the hall . Um , so I'll just show you how that works . Basically , you can see Gisella sort of there in the middle with the fax machine , and Maggie and Susan , who are the two full professors in our department have the private offices . And the photocopier and the printer are sort of in the hall on the side there across from mailboxes . Um , just to go back , most people are grouped in projects . And we have two fifty per cent people who are half time in Geneva , half time at the E_P_F_L_ in Lausanne . And they m them we've put in three person offices , so that in the three person offices it's not constantly three people . So there's a little bit of give there . And",IB4005.
78.44,78.57,B,Mm-hmm,IB4005.
78.56,78.67,A,the,IB4005.
78.57,78.57,B,.,IB4005.
78.67,94.32,A,"reading room , or the lounge as some people call it , that we have is in a central position . So basically we've got Andre and Nancy at the top . Um they don't actu they will be starting a new project together , if um if I'm not mistaken . Like I said",IB4005.
94.29,94.62,C,Mm-hmm,IB4005.
94.32,94.64,A,", Susan",IB4005.
94.62,94.62,C,.,IB4005.
94.64,158.5,A,"and Maggie in the individual offices . Nikos and Yalina , who work on the same project , at the bottom . The reading room is in the middle . Um , Marianne and Bruno are at the bottom . Um , as well , Marianne works closely with Pierrette and the other Marianne . We have two Mariannes in our department . And David is a half time . So as I said , the half times are in the three person offices . And on the other side we have Maria , Martin and myself , who all work on the same project . And Martin is fifty per cent . Um Gisella , we've given her two person office for two reasons , one is because there's a spare place there , so if we want to put a stagieur or someone who just comes in for short period of time , we figured it was okay if they were in the admin office which is a little bit noisy , because they're only there for a short period of time . Um , and again the proximity to the other offices . Um so I guess that's pretty much it for our proposal",IB4005.
158.1,158.38,C,Mm-hmm .,IB4005.
158.5,162.53,A,. Um I don't know if you want Andre to go through his first or if you have any questions for me .,IB4005.

463.06,463.73,A,So,IB4005.
464.21,546.94,C,"Yeah , please . Thanks . Perfect . So um , yeah , actually we um Well , basically the the group who produced this uh proposal is made by Susan , Martin , David and uh and myself . And we also well , Susan volunteered to ask Maggie and Pierrette about how they they felt about sharing offices , and . So , as you can see , well um Susan gets obviously the same office , which is quite a good thing . Um , then things started move a bit . It looks like I'm also in the same position . But the most obvious constraints that uh we we found here was that it was probably very difficult to have a lounge uh just a lounge in one room , because it would block us two full working places . And although it's true that the group , I agree , decided to to had to have a lounge , we propose to put the lounge uh in the room at the the upper side on on the right . Uh , so let two people share this with uh sort of a , yeah , a place where we have a sofa maybe and uh and some books . So it's obviously a calm place . People are not there to talk very loud , but they can sit and relax , and uh still look at at the mountains . Um , also So that's one of the main differences , I think , maybe one of the points",IB4005.
546.87,547.29,A,Mm-hmm,IB4005.
546.94,547.38,C,that we have,IB4005.
547.29,547.29,A,.,IB4005.
547.38,643.43,C,"to talk about . Uh the other one is the admin office . So it's Gisella fifty per cent because she's only half time , and uh the fax machine . Um Gisella actually has a lot of phone calls to make and uh it's true that her activity is quite noisy when she's there . Um , it's also true that she has quite a lot of files for most of the the projects actually that we manage , so it appeared , at least to well to our group , that even if she's here only half time , she should have an office by her own because it would be quite disturbing for other people to to work in the the same office . Uh Gisella has has no objection against sharing the office . We thought it was more for the the calm of the the people . It's true that this blocks one of the one person rooms , but uh on the other hand , uh Maggie has no objection uh sharing an office with her assistant . And this appeared to be true also of Pierrette . We don't know about Pierrette sharing an office with two persons , but at least no problem in Pierrette sharing her office with uh Marianne , the the Swedish one , who is sort of her assistant . Um so this is why we , yeah , we put Maggie with with Bruno . And then the third main difference uh would be the the number of visitor places or free places . Uh you notice a new name in the room uh at the centre upper upper side . So that's Paola . It's true that it's someone coming next year , Susan reminded me this uh of this point , and I",IB4005.

656.72,657.1,A,Yeah .,IB4005.
657.41,694.47,C,"spare place . Um we didn't really reach a very good agreement on the distribution of these two rooms . So the the two at the centre , uh where is written Paola , Yalina , the two visitors and then Maria plus David . So I think there is quite a lot of space here to uh switch a little bit among the people , just to make some kind of smooth occupancy rate , so not to have one empty room when we have no visitors , um and uh then a very full room when everybody is is here . So I think we're we are quite willing to split and put say maybe one visitor with Maria and",IB4005.

727.12,761.93,C,"So we should manage some kind of decent space . It's true that these one or two last one or two years we didn't have uh a visiting professor . But um Yeah , so uh I think , yeah , these are the three main points . So one is the place of the lounge . Uh , the other one is the uh the place of the admin office with Gisella . And the third one is the number of visitor visiting people and uh , well , how many of them we want to accommodate and where where we put it . These , I think , are the three main differences .
