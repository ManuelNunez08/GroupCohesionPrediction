Okay . Every meeting we everybody can present their uh their views and everything , so to help with these , you have we have the SMARTboards here . We can use a regular PowerPoint presentation . I'm supposed to give you an introduction on this doodling board , so it's actually it's very easy . Like it says , very simple , you just take out the pen . Like you see here , I'll just take the take here . That's it , you just put it on the board . You see a pen here . You go here , just like using a pen . You can just draw whatever you want . It's like the eraser , can erase whatever you want . And so it will be easy just to illustrate your views , if you wanna change the format , you just either take out jus just like the pen , and whatever you want , your current colour , your line width , just to make the line bigger .

So I'll take this out . Okay . We'll use that later . Anyway . Yeah , just just just stuff that you wanna share , just put it in the in the project folder , like I put my presentation now . I'll put the the minutes of every meeting , I'll put them there too , so everybody can read up if they have to leave early or whatever . So next , been here .

1864.62,1864.62,B,.,TS3012c
1864.71,1870.05,A,think so . That's why I asked you . Okay . So,TS3012c
1871.6,1873.04,C,I would curve the whole actually .,TS3012c
1874.57,1874.84,B,Hmm ?,TS3012c

1900.4,1901.03,C,"Yes , exactly .",TS3012c
1901.32,1903.59,A,Stop the curve here or continue it,TS3012c

1906.88,1907.07,D,Yep .,TS3012c

660.04,662.96,C,I'd say lose the curve,TS3012d
662.88,663.09,A,I say,TS3012d
662.96,663.18,C,and,TS3012d
663.09,663.3,A,lose,TS3012d
663.18,664.21,C,the colour,TS3012d
663.3,664.3,A,the curve,TS3012d
664.21,664.69,C,and,TS3012d
664.3,670.82,A,". Oh that's true , we could lose the c yeah , I forgot that , sorry . Uh the curve . So",TS3012d
668.95,671.18,B,So which curve is that ba that's basically,TS3012d
670.82,671.33,A,That's just,TS3012d
671.18,671.47,B,that,TS3012d
671.33,671.54,A,this,TS3012d
671.47,671.74,B,curve,TS3012d
671.54,671.99,A,one just,TS3012d
671.74,671.74,B,.,TS3012d
671.99,673.26,A,d this is the banana curve,TS3012d
673.11,673.49,C,Hmm,TS3012d
673.26,673.26,A,.,TS3012d
673.49,673.49,C,.,TS3012d
674.84,675.11,D,Yeah,TS3012d
675.08,675.33,A,So,TS3012d
675.11,675.33,D,", that's",TS3012d
675.24,675.39,B,So,TS3012d
675.33,675.52,A,this,TS3012d
675.33,675.72,D,better,TS3012d
675.39,675.82,B,we could,TS3012d
675.52,675.87,A,would,TS3012d
675.72,675.72,D,.,TS3012d
675.82,675.92,B,u,TS3012d
675.87,676.15,A,this,TS3012d
675.92,676.29,B,still,TS3012d
676.15,676.39,A,would,TS3012d
676.29,676.51,B,have,TS3012d
676.39,676.85,A,be straight,TS3012d
676.51,677.17,B,the comfort,TS3012d
676.85,676.85,A,.,TS3012d
677.17,677.17,B,.,TS3012d
678.48,686.56,A,"No , uh no , that would be a curve inside the thing , I guess . No , would ju then it would just be a straight remote . Just like like that",TS3012d
686.38,686.6,C,Hmm,TS3012d
686.56,686.56,A,.,TS3012d
686.6,686.6,C,.,TS3012d
689.77,695.22,A,"Which would , yeah , turn it into something far more ordinary . we could make",TS3012d
695.21,695.9,B,I,TS3012d
695.22,696.06,A,"it yellow then , but",TS3012d
695.9,696.96,B,second that .,TS3012d
697.91,699.76,A,"You second that , you second that we lose the curve .",TS3012d
700.25,705.01,B,"No , that it would turn out to be a pretty straight-forward remote control",TS3012d
704.91,705.3,A,Okay,TS3012d
705.01,705.89,B,. So that's,TS3012d
705.24,706.21,D,Yeah,TS3012d
705.3,705.54,A,", yeah .",TS3012d
705.89,707.32,B,not really,TS3012d
706.21,706.48,D,. Yeah .,TS3012d
706.75,707.37,A,So I think it,TS3012d
707.32,708.36,B,that,TS3012d
707.37,712.03,A,would be a good idea to keep the curve to separate it from the rest of the remote control,TS3012d
711.88,712.16,C,Hmm,TS3012d
712.03,713.03,A,world,TS3012d
712.16,712.16,C,.,TS3012d
713.03,718.04,A,", so to speak . So we keep the curve . So",TS3012d
717.88,718.4,B,I would,TS3012d
718.04,726.9,A,"the only only solution is either to use the l y lose the yellow or lose the rubber . And I'm in favour of keeping the rubber , because it has more",TS3012d
726.64,726.79,C,Oh .,TS3012d
726.9,728.62,A,more advantages,TS3012d
728.35,728.71,C,I agree,TS3012d
728.62,728.82,A,than,TS3012d
728.71,728.71,C,.,TS3012d
728.82,729.38,A,the colour yellow,TS3012d
729.32,730.09,B,Yeah,TS3012d
729.38,729.69,A,has .,TS3012d
730.09,730.45,B,. I would,TS3012d
730.32,730.53,C,No,TS3012d

730.49,730.68,D,Yep,TS3012d
730.53,730.53,C,.,TS3012d
730.68,730.68,D,.,TS3012d
731.95,737.07,B,"I would agree with you on the colour , because that's an extra option , an extra service we can deliver for",TS3012d
736.97,737.28,A,Mm-hmm,TS3012d
737.07,737.34,B,a little,TS3012d
737.28,737.28,A,.,TS3012d
737.34,739.88,B,bit of more money . So,TS3012d
739.15,739.99,A,"Yeah , um I guess",TS3012d
739.88,739.99,B,we,TS3012d
739.99,740.31,A,people,TS3012d
739.99,740.34,B,can always,TS3012d
740.31,740.5,A,are,TS3012d
740.34,740.52,B,do,TS3012d
740.5,740.76,A,willing,TS3012d

740.82,740.82,B,.,TS3012d
740.87,742.0,A,pay for that . So I think we can,TS3012d
741.89,742.22,D,Yeah,TS3012d
742.0,742.33,A,take that,TS3012d
742.19,742.61,C,Hmm,TS3012d
742.22,742.22,D,.,TS3012d
742.33,742.84,A,option,TS3012d
742.61,742.61,C,?,TS3012d
742.84,747.96,A,and just with uh with the idea in the back of our head that you can customise your remote control . So,TS3012d
747.88,748.09,C,Yes,TS3012d
747.96,748.24,A,I think,TS3012d
748.09,748.09,C,.,TS3012d
748.24,761.41,A,"that would still make it a nice product . Okay , we're final on that . So it's too bad we can't make the whole super thing . But anyways we're here . Um",TS3012d
761.4,761.54,B,Which,TS3012d
761.41,761.71,A,yeah,TS3012d
761.54,762.11,B,is basically,TS3012d
761.71,761.71,A,.,TS3012d
762.11,763.09,B,what we discussed,TS3012d

771.73,771.73,D,.,TS3012d
771.78,783.82,A,"expected that everything would turn out this way , but because you yeah , everything cannot be for free . We didn't I think it was too bad we didn't have the financial info the last time . Because",TS3012d
783.51,785.08,B,Yes,TS3012d
783.82,783.96,A,that,TS3012d
783.83,784.0,C,Huh,TS3012d

785.33,785.61,B,have,TS3012d
785.52,792.99,A,essential really to ma because we spent uh uh entire stage designing a product of which we had no idea what,TS3012d
792.89,793.17,C,Hmm,TS3012d
792.99,793.22,A,it would,TS3012d
793.17,793.17,C,.,TS3012d
793.22,794.5,A,cost . So we just,TS3012d
794.44,794.72,D,Yeah,TS3012d

794.72,794.72,D,.,TS3012d
795.84,800.67,A,I think it's really nor not in stroke with reality actually . So,TS3012d
800.42,802.94,C,"Me too , I felt a bit blind throughout the project , because",TS3012d
802.79,803.14,A,Yeah,TS3012d
