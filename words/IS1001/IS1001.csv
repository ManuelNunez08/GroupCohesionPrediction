So I will first start with a warm welcome opening stuff , then uh we will uh see what will be uh our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it . And uh then we will uh discuss if we have few ideas and we will uh end uh by uh dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process . So",IS1001a
127.83,136.45,B,"Uh . Just one thing . Uh , you said twenty-five minutes , but I have something else to do uh , so gotta have another meeting uh soon , so maybe you could hurry up a bit",IS1001a

149.03,149.31,B,Okay .,IS1001a
149.79,234.13,A,". So the the goal is to have a remote control so to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original , we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user-friendly . So uh the design step will be divided in three uh main points . First it will be the functional design . Third is the conceptual design and then is the desired design . So the functional design is to identify the main user needs , the technical function the remote control should fulfil . And then we will move to f conceptual design where we'll specify the different component involved , what kind of user interf interface we want and what are the different uh trend in user interface and stuff like that . And then the desired devi design will consist in uh specifically implementing and detailing the choice we've uh made in the second point . So I will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for to uh each of us to to draw uh your favourite animal on the white board .",IS1001a

509.22,515.01,A,"Okay , so if it selled uh by its own i it it would rather be for multiple device .",IS1001a

209.15,209.5,A,that's,IS1001b
209.43,214.68,B,uh . Basically what we want here is a remote control right,IS1001b
214.1,214.47,A,Yeah .,IS1001b
214.68,224.18,B,. So um the question well first of all what to control . So most people want to have a a remote for their hi-fi and T_V_ and stuff like that,IS1001b
223.54,223.93,C,Mm-hmm .,IS1001b
224.18,232.46,B,. And but other people want th also remotes for controlling uh and toys like robotic pets and,IS1001b

232.46,233.07,B,little robots,IS1001b
232.73,232.73,C,.,IS1001b
233.07,239.52,B,and stuff and other people also want to have remotes for controlling um whole house .,IS1001b

240.62,240.62,A,.,IS1001b
241.01,249.33,B,", so there's a project I think called X_ house or something like that that does that , uh you can integrate your remote with uh computers stuff",IS1001b
249.16,249.44,C,Mm-hmm,IS1001b
249.33,250.96,B,. So,IS1001b
249.44,249.44,C,.,IS1001b
250.96,260.1,B,there is one that is one thing . The other is the the finder feature yeah by whistling or whatever . Uh,IS1001b
259.52,259.85,C,Okay .,IS1001b
260.1,267.41,B,if you have the finder feature then you can also have uh at the same time as and general voice commands if you want yeah .,IS1001b
267.94,268.25,C,Mm-hmm .,IS1001b
268.43,286.37,B,So I think it should be a package in that case . Uh so the user interface will consist of two parts . One is the voice command part and on one is the actual buttons part . Uh and th the buttons part would be uh a set of buttons for choosing devices,IS1001b
285.51,285.85,C,Mm-hmm .,IS1001b
286.37,289.25,B,", a set of buttons for special navigation in space ,",IS1001b

300.87,301.13,B,Yeah,IS1001b

301.13,301.13,B,?,IS1001b
301.22,302.81,C,do you mean by linear access then ?,IS1001b
302.82,305.27,B,"Like a video tape goes forward , backwards",IS1001b

305.27,309.01,B,", uh fast and stuff yeah . Um",IS1001b

309.01,309.01,B,.,IS1001b
309.13,314.03,A,"special navigation , linear access , random access and there's a fourth one no ?",IS1001b
314.73,314.95,B,Mm ?,IS1001b
316.15,318.53,A,So the better now for special navigation ?,IS1001b
319.04,322.39,B,Yeah . For special navigation for example you might have a T_V_ in the menu and you going to,IS1001b
322.31,323.38,A,Okay,IS1001b
322.39,323.92,B,change yeah,IS1001b
323.38,324.02,A,. Then linear,IS1001b

325.51,326.43,A,random access .,IS1001b
326.45,328.69,B,. Yeah and also parameter,IS1001b
328.46,328.87,A,Ah yeah,IS1001b
328.69,330.19,B,changing,IS1001b
328.87,329.8,A,parameter okay .,IS1001b
330.19,334.27,B,. So if there are common parameters maybe we should put special buttons for that,IS1001b

334.33,334.33,A,.,IS1001b
335.41,343.62,B,or maybe we could have everything uh generic but uh there are a lot of uh remotes on the market right now,IS1001b

921.28,921.28,A,.,IS1001b
921.74,925.97,B,Mm I it's not true I think . The,IS1001b
925.59,926.28,C,No no,IS1001b
925.97,926.56,B,the second,IS1001b
926.28,926.28,C,.,IS1001b
926.56,927.55,B,claim that you put .,IS1001b
928.1,929.65,A,That it would be too long to,IS1001b
929.55,930.29,B,Yeah,IS1001b
929.65,930.0,A,develop .,IS1001b
930.29,931.77,B,. I think that should be the same .,IS1001b
932.72,954.38,A,Oh yeah . Because I received that email from management board and they seems to tell that that if we want to be on the market as early as possible we should uh focus on T_V_ more where it seems that the market is more important . So maybe it's a good decision . I dunno . What's your,IS1001b
954.18,954.6,B,I have,IS1001b
954.38,954.69,A,opinion,IS1001b

954.69,954.69,A,?,IS1001b
954.8,963.58,B,I've no idea I mean I should know a bit more about how fast we can uh design it . I don't think Uh yeah .,IS1001b
964.1,966.62,C,Finish tonight,IS1001b
965.39,967.51,B,Yeah . Okay,IS1001b
966.62,967.55,C,. But basically yeah,IS1001b
967.51,967.76,B,. Yeah,IS1001b
967.55,968.38,C,maybe,IS1001b
967.76,967.76,B,.,IS1001b
968.38,970.93,C,"I can continue with my presentation , it would be",IS1001b
970.92,971.32,A,Okay,IS1001b
970.93,971.28,C,al,IS1001b
971.14,971.28,D,Yeah,IS1001b
971.28,971.59,C,you,IS1001b
971.28,971.28,D,.,IS1001b
971.3,971.44,B,Yeah,IS1001b
971.32,971.32,A,.,IS1001b
971.44,971.44,B,.,IS1001b
971.59,979.1,C,you but I think we have some technical problem or so . So I'm just going to describe briefly what we do in the remote control,IS1001b
978.93,979.15,A,Maybe,IS1001b
979.1,979.31,C,. If,IS1001b
979.15,979.54,A,you can,IS1001b
979.31,979.51,C,fact,IS1001b
979.54,982.33,A,go to the whiteboard if you have some drawings to do I,IS1001b
982.28,982.51,C,Yeah,IS1001b
982.33,982.47,A,don't,IS1001b
982.42,982.77,D,Mm,IS1001b
982.47,982.64,A,know,IS1001b
982.51,982.81,C,but,IS1001b
982.64,982.64,A,.,IS1001b
982.77,982.77,D,.,IS1001b
984.06,987.78,C,Do I have oh yeah . Now I have enough cables .,IS1001b
988.18,991.47,B,Like a you feel a bit like a dog with this stuff .,IS1001b
992.36,1000.79,C,"Okay so I'm just going to describe in fact for for a remote control this is quite easy . We just have sorry , I'm going",IS1001b
1003.68,1005.87,A,Okay . Are you okay,IS1001b
1005.06,1006.13,C,Like that,IS1001b
1005.87,1005.87,A,?,IS1001b
1006.13,1060.77,C,". I'm just going to describe . Basically we have a a battery a power supply here . After that we just have um user interface . Let's say that um something like that , which could be um a L_C_D_ let's say or um an array of push button , something like that . Push button or a L_C_D_ . After that we we feed that into um uh an electronic chip . So I say U_C_ and I feed that to uh L_E_D_ which is uh infrared um which is a an infrared um component . And so what we for for myself this for for us this is quite easy .",IS1001b
1061.01,1062.58,A,U_C_ is the central unit ?,IS1001b
1063.53,1064.33,C,Yeah,IS1001b
1064.13,1064.39,A,Okay,IS1001b
1064.33,1064.53,C,. Y,IS1001b
1064.39,1064.56,A,yeah,IS1001b
1064.53,1064.7,C,it's,IS1001b
1064.56,1064.56,A,.,IS1001b
1064.7,1071.31,C,a it's this just a chip which does all the um numerical,IS1001b
1071.73,1072.47,A,Computation,IS1001b
1072.4,1073.05,C,numerical,IS1001b
1072.47,1072.47,A,.,IS1001b
1073.05,1074.01,C,computation,IS1001b
1073.72,1073.93,A,Okay .,IS1001b
1074.01,1096.69,C,according to your display . And so for us uh this is quite easy . We just need to take to define what we want to do when the user interface um wants something and after that we just do the coding to s and send that to to to the not the to the television,IS1001b
1096.23,1096.64,A,Okay .,IS1001b
1096.69,1098.48,C,. So for us this is quite easy .,IS1001b
1099.0,1101.09,A,Okay so this is quite easy,IS1001b
1100.69,1101.66,C,Yeah . Um,IS1001b
1101.09,1101.83,A,. There is not that much,IS1001b
1101.66,1102.03,C,we just,IS1001b
1101.83,1102.37,A,constraints,IS1001b
1102.03,1103.06,C,have to define,IS1001b
1102.37,1102.37,A,.,IS1001b
1103.06,1113.3,C,"the processing power that we need uh especially if we want to do some uh speech recognition , in that case that mean that we are going to use more",IS1001b
1113.16,1113.44,B,This,IS1001b
1113.3,1113.98,C,for simple,IS1001b
1113.44,1115.48,B,will think this will take more time to develop,IS1001b
1115.44,1115.75,C,Yeah,IS1001b
1115.48,1116.35,B,also,IS1001b
1115.75,1116.47,C,of course of,IS1001b
1116.35,1117.53,B,. Yeah,IS1001b
1116.47,1117.81,C,course . And,IS1001b
1117.53,1117.53,B,.,IS1001b
1117.81,1123.9,C,um but for a standard one this is really easy . It's a question of one,IS1001b
1123.72,1124.28,B,Soon,IS1001b
1123.9,1124.51,C,month and,IS1001b
1124.28,1124.28,B,.,IS1001b
1124.51,1124.77,C,so,IS1001b
1124.71,1124.78,A,To,IS1001b
1124.77,1125.06,C,on,IS1001b
1124.78,1126.28,A,have a,IS1001b
1125.06,1125.16,C,s,IS1001b
1126.28,1128.51,A,you s you speak about with voi voice control ?,IS1001b
1128.74,1130.84,C,"No no no no , I say",IS1001b
1129.75,1131.61,A,Standard button one,IS1001b
1130.84,1131.72,C,yeah standard,IS1001b
1131.61,1131.61,A,.,IS1001b
1131.72,1136.0,C,uh standard remote control takes maybe uh one month to to do that .,IS1001b
1136.7,1141.17,B,Yeah . So the only time problem is the sp voice recognition,IS1001b
1140.6,1141.39,C,Yeah,IS1001b
1141.17,1142.39,B,. Yeah,IS1001b
1141.39,1142.01,C,. Definitely .,IS1001b
1142.39,1142.57,B,. Yeah .,IS1001b
1143.41,1148.16,A,So do you have any idea of how long it would take to have voice recognition now ?,IS1001b
1148.6,1151.07,C,I would say,IS1001b
1149.3,1149.74,B,Ten years .,IS1001b
1151.07,1159.1,C,. I would say uh about eight months to have the first results .,IS1001b
1159.56,1161.66,A,Okay so i it's a bit long yeah .,IS1001b
1161.8,1168.0,C,Yeah . I can Um .,IS1001b
1174.66,1177.88,A,One month for the standard one with button,IS1001b
1176.85,1177.17,C,Yeah .,IS1001b
1177.88,1179.83,A,. Even if we have a L_C_D_ display ?,IS1001b
1180.12,1190.53,C,Yeah even . I mean that this is really standard devices now . Um eight . For uh speech recognition .,IS1001b
1193.85,1205.61,A,Okay yeah . Okay so we can take this into account . So who think it would be good to go for uh like speech recognition ?,IS1001b
1206.48,1207.91,B,But we don't have time to market .,IS1001b
1208.93,1209.6,C,And also,IS1001b
1209.28,1209.69,A,Yeah it,IS1001b
1209.6,1209.74,C,how,IS1001b
1209.69,1209.85,A,will,IS1001b
1209.74,1210.41,C,much,IS1001b
1209.85,1209.85,A,.,IS1001b
1210.41,1211.57,C,uh I think,IS1001b
1212.63,1213.44,B,I think we should contact,IS1001b
1213.21,1213.56,C,during,IS1001b
1213.44,1213.97,B,management,IS1001b
1213.56,1214.77,C,the kickoff,IS1001b
1213.97,1213.97,B,.,IS1001b
1214.77,1222.22,C,meeting you say that we we shouldn't we shouldn't go up to twelve point five Euro,IS1001b
1221.69,1222.46,A,Euros,IS1001b
1222.22,1222.57,C,per,IS1001b
1222.46,1223.15,A,. Yeah,IS1001b
1222.57,1223.92,C,unit,IS1001b
1223.15,1223.52,A,", yeah .",IS1001b
1223.92,1227.94,C,so how many units should we sell to have a,IS1001b
1231.75,1232.59,B,Well,IS1001b
1232.4,1232.79,A,Well,IS1001b
1232.59,1232.84,B,. Uh,IS1001b
1232.79,1235.58,A,each unit is is sell uh twenty five Euros .,IS1001b
1236.46,1237.89,C,Yeah but how many yeah .,IS1001b
1239.25,1248.35,B,"How muc how much do you get how much do you if you buy one million units h no , one hundred thousand units . Eh chips . We're gonna need chips right .",IS1001b
1248.9,1249.11,C,Yeah .,IS1001b
1249.48,1252.22,B,Yeah . How much will it cost for one hundred thousand ?,IS1001b
1252.75,1255.7,C,Usually this is less tha at two dollars per chip .,IS1001b
1256.16,1256.57,B,Okay .,IS1001b
1257.6,1257.82,A,Because,IS1001b
1257.67,1257.93,B,So,IS1001b
1257.82,1257.94,A,we,IS1001b
1257.93,1258.04,B,you,IS1001b
1257.94,1258.08,A,are,IS1001b
1258.04,1262.31,B,have any idea for a powerful one that has uh good enough for do speech recognition .,IS1001b
1263.63,1264.96,C,Yeah,IS1001b
1264.48,1265.21,B,Yeah ? Okay,IS1001b
1264.96,1266.16,C,", we can",IS1001b
1265.21,1267.21,B,. So . No,IS1001b
1267.19,1267.27,A,It,IS1001b
1267.21,1267.32,B,it,IS1001b
1267.27,1267.54,A,seems,IS1001b
1267.32,1267.61,B,doesn't,IS1001b
1267.54,1267.97,A,that,IS1001b
1267.61,1267.61,B,.,IS1001b
1267.97,1272.72,A,that we want to sell like four million units from the,IS1001b
1272.2,1273.35,C,Mm-hmm,IS1001b
1272.72,1273.51,A,first meeting,IS1001b
1273.35,1273.35,C,.,IS1001b
1273.51,1273.51,A,.,IS1001b
1275.16,1277.72,B,Okay . Four million .,IS1001b
1278.76,1287.53,A,Okay . Maybe we can uh we can look at the new requirement I receive from the management board and discus discuss all function we want to have .,IS1001b
1288.27,1288.35,D,Mm .,IS1001b
1291.18,1298.16,C,Um I just had a question uh do you want to continue with your presenta,IS1001b
1298.14,1298.39,A,Yeah,IS1001b
1298.16,1298.74,C,? Is,IS1001b
1298.39,1298.78,A,I,IS1001b
1298.74,1298.92,C,it,IS1001b
1298.78,1303.27,A,I will continue . Well ask your question if you want,IS1001b
1301.94,1303.98,C,Um you say that,IS1001b
1303.27,1303.27,A,.,IS1001b
1303.98,1307.23,C,I don't remember by heart but thirty per cent,IS1001b
1307.81,1308.11,D,Mm ?,IS1001b
1308.6,1316.96,C,of the tested people say that's it's quite difficult to to to use the remote control .,IS1001b
1317.34,1317.68,D,Yeah .,IS1001b
1318.37,1324.99,C,Do they say that this is difficult but for the same reason or do they have other reason ?,IS1001b
1326.63,1327.11,D,Oh,IS1001b
1326.81,1327.36,C,To to,IS1001b
1327.11,1328.01,D,. Would j,IS1001b
1327.36,1332.07,C,maybe to keep in mind maybe to access to that menu you should do something like,IS1001b
1331.96,1332.53,D,Uh,IS1001b
1332.07,1332.5,C,that .,IS1001b
1332.53,1338.61,D,yeah w I I think they they say that it's uh difficult to learn how to use it,IS1001b
1338.5,1338.87,C,Mm-hmm,IS1001b
1338.61,1338.9,D,but i,IS1001b
1338.87,1338.87,C,.,IS1001b
1338.9,1340.55,D,when you know how to use it,IS1001b
1340.44,1341.87,C,Mm-hmm,IS1001b
1340.55,1341.06,D,", it's it's",IS1001b
1340.98,1342.13,A,Okay,IS1001b
1341.06,1342.07,D,okay,IS1001b
1341.87,1342.09,C,. And,IS1001b
1342.07,1342.25,D,. But,IS1001b
1342.13,1343.86,A,. It's not intuitive first,IS1001b
1343.53,1343.89,D,Yeah,IS1001b
1343.86,1343.86,A,.,IS1001b
1343.89,1343.89,D,.,IS1001b
1344.11,1353.7,C,"But yeah maybe and what about if we design a remote control which can be configure as you want ? You say that I want , I have six",IS1001b
1353.49,1353.94,B,Mh-hmm,IS1001b
1353.7,1354.12,C,button,IS1001b
1353.94,1357.07,B,. A a lot of people are uh if you have the L_C_D_ screen,IS1001b
1356.62,1356.94,C,Yeah .,IS1001b
1357.07,1357.98,B,if you can,IS1001b
1357.67,1357.94,A,Yeah .,IS1001b
1357.98,1361.19,B,do it completely the way you want because the buttons also look,IS1001b
1360.87,1361.12,C,Yeah .,IS1001b
1361.19,1361.44,B,the way,IS1001b
1361.36,1362.26,A,But,IS1001b

1362.26,1362.72,A,", but also",IS1001b
1362.61,1362.87,B,but,IS1001b
1362.72,1363.22,A,it seems,IS1001b
1362.87,1363.59,B,it will be,IS1001b
1363.22,1363.44,A,that,IS1001b
1363.59,1366.08,B,hard to configure I mean imagine,IS1001b
1365.1,1365.45,C,Yeah,IS1001b
1365.17,1365.44,A,Yeah .,IS1001b
1365.45,1365.45,C,.,IS1001b
1366.08,1369.55,B,i uh so it's really something for the expert user,IS1001b
1369.5,1369.86,C,Okay,IS1001b
1369.55,1370.0,B,. So,IS1001b
1369.86,1369.86,C,.,IS1001b
1371.08,1378.59,B,I mean there are markets and markets . I think the young people are th uh are uh Christine here said uh,IS1001b
1378.02,1378.28,C,Yeah .,IS1001b
1378.59,1380.18,B,you have a,IS1001b
1379.91,1380.14,A,Yeah .,IS1001b
1380.18,1389.41,B,"uh it is yeah . So for our young people uh it will be cool , they can be able to use it . Th maybe their parents will not but they will configure it . I guess . I don't know if there is",IS1001b
1389.4,1390.24,A,Yeah,IS1001b
1389.41,1390.42,B,study about,IS1001b
1390.16,1390.44,C,Mm-hmm,IS1001b
1390.24,1390.52,A,. Maybe,IS1001b

1397.03,1397.03,C,.,IS1001b
1397.22,1404.95,B,another thing is that if we make something that's simple and easy to use that's bas to use immediately that means that it will be exactly the same as everything else,IS1001b
1404.68,1405.65,C,Yeah,IS1001b
1404.95,1405.21,B,. All right ?,IS1001b
1405.65,1405.82,C,. Yeah .,IS1001b
1406.77,1411.45,B,"Otherwise , if it's different then of course everybody has somebody has to learn to use it first .",IS1001b
1411.64,1411.77,C,Yeah,IS1001b
1411.66,1412.31,A,Yeah,IS1001b
1411.77,1411.77,C,.,IS1001b
1412.31,1423.88,A,. But also we we see that that most people find it find remote controls too complex because they have too many buttons and they mainly use only channels,IS1001b
1423.67,1423.8,D,Mm .,IS1001b
1423.88,1424.12,A,and,IS1001b
1423.93,1424.49,B,Mm-hmm,IS1001b

1424.49,1424.49,B,.,IS1001b
1424.93,1434.08,A,buttons . So we may just uh make a very easy to use remote control with mainly those buttons,IS1001b
1433.5,1433.83,B,Yeah .,IS1001b
1434.08,1447.77,A,and maybe also um some lightning stuff too because most people find also hard to to find the remote control . Losed,IS1001b
1447.07,1447.57,B,Mm-hmm .,IS1001b
1447.77,1467.8,A,lose it etcetera . These these are these two points are the main frustrations so maybe if we design something very simple and easy to uh find when lost it will uh add uh a serious competitive advantage without,IS1001b
1467.36,1467.87,D,Mm,IS1001b
1467.8,1468.24,A,making,IS1001b

1471.87,1472.17,B,Mm-hmm .,IS1001b
1472.97,1495.41,A,So but le let us see first the new requirement . So we don't have to so this this uh is uh is um in the this is in the same direction as we were speaking so we don't have to make a very complex remote controls to access teletext and stuff like that,IS1001b
1494.49,1496.26,B,But teletext is just one button .,IS1001b
1497.24,1502.06,A,Yeah but then you have to you have to define the buttons to surf,IS1001b

1511.36,1520.16,A,". So anyway we don't have to include this feature because it's it's not used any more by users , they prefer to s",IS1001b
1520.1,1525.05,B,I am . I'm sure that uh it don't like but uh I don't see just one button .,IS1001b
1525.88,1527.07,A,Yeah,IS1001b
1526.84,1527.05,B,So .,IS1001b
1527.07,1537.97,A,. I dunno . If i one button is still one more button . If if if we want to make it very simple we have to reduce number of buttons compared to th to our competitors .,IS1001b
1539.01,1539.3,B,Mm-hmm .,IS1001b
1540.07,1607.65,A,Well anyway I have this point . We can discuss . Also um so as as I told before uh it would be better if it's only for the T_V_ um because we want to be quick on on the market . And then also we have to make very uh uh clear that this uh this remote control is is part of of our products and show our corporate uh logo and and colours on the on the design as well so that uh they identify it as one of our product . So this is the the key point . So before uh finishing we can uh define uh what would be the characteristic of the o th of the control of the remote control and which button do we need which function do we want etcetera .,IS1001b

1628.8,1639.71,A,and most button are never used only ten per cent of the button are are used often so I think we have to do something very simple and I think we all agree on that point,IS1001b

So each of you will uh show us the various investigation they've done during uh previous uh hours . We'll then t take decision in concert and then uh uh we will uh define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting . So , last time we decided to have a simple interface . We also decided to have a wheel to change channel previous channel button . Channel digit uh buttons should be uh protected by plastic cover or something for the remote control to look very simple . We have also button for volume , and to switch on off the T_V_ . We have also uh the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find , and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no L_C_D_ no voice features . So now uh we will have three presentations . So the conceptual specification by Industrial Designer , the specification of the U_I_ by or",IS1001c

513.47,513.7,A,. Yeah .,IS1001c
514.31,530.33,C,"So I just look at some current designs uh on the web , of usually more complicated remote controls . And let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple . And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need",IS1001c
530.12,530.5,A,Yeah,IS1001c
530.33,530.56,C,and it,IS1001c

559.12,567.22,C,"on the left one is exactly the same . So it's basically more or less how we would like it , with a big volume control , big channel control , and mute and power , yeah",IS1001c
567.03,568.14,A,Yeah,IS1001c
567.22,567.96,C,? These are the basic thing .,IS1001c

574.47,579.48,A,Yeah . With a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the,IS1001c

580.06,580.06,A,.,IS1001c
581.5,585.6,C,I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb . It,IS1001c
585.58,585.87,A,Yeah,IS1001c
585.6,586.48,C,could be,IS1001c

586.48,588.46,C,"on the right side , for example",IS1001c

588.46,589.4,C,. Yeah,IS1001c
588.51,588.51,A,.,IS1001c
589.4,595.7,C,. Because we don't have these input buttons and this other stuff that they have . And I think that the plastic cover is not very good uh,IS1001c
595.41,595.77,A,Okay,IS1001c
595.7,596.22,C,idea,IS1001c
595.77,595.77,A,.,IS1001c
596.22,602.01,C,"because you open it , it can break , you ca you can do various things . Uh",IS1001c
601.14,602.34,A,Okay,IS1001c
602.01,602.45,C,you just need,IS1001c
602.34,602.5,A,. S,IS1001c
602.45,606.07,C,to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way .,IS1001c
607.06,607.81,A,Okay,IS1001c
607.72,607.87,C,So,IS1001c
607.81,608.18,A,. Will,IS1001c
607.87,608.66,C,that they're separate,IS1001c
608.18,608.8,A,be down,IS1001c
608.66,609.16,C,a bit,IS1001c

609.16,610.26,C,", yeah",IS1001c
609.24,609.6,A,Okay .,IS1001c
610.26,622.52,C,". Uh and it's easy to press the other the big buttons , but uh , it's not that difficult to press the the channel buttons either . Mm . Yeah , I think that if you put the cover it will be even more difficult for the user .",IS1001c
622.76,623.27,A,Okay .,IS1001c
625.15,634.71,C,"Alright , you won't yeah . Usually what I have noticed that people put the plastic cover on things that you normally don't mess with , like buttons for t uh tuning the channels and",IS1001c
634.71,635.25,A,Okay,IS1001c
634.71,636.46,C,stuff like that,IS1001c
635.25,635.25,A,.,IS1001c
636.46,641.34,C,. Yeah . That you want to protect a bit . And I think it's uh it's reasonable .,IS1001c
642.05,642.46,A,Okay .,IS1001c
642.86,647.87,C,"So , I don't think Yeah , this is just the the wheel . We could",IS1001c
647.81,648.06,A,Mm,IS1001c
647.87,648.06,C,use,IS1001c
648.06,648.06,A,.,IS1001c
648.06,652.63,C,"the some wheels can be pushed down , could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want .",IS1001c
653.42,653.75,B,Mm-hmm .,IS1001c
654.19,661.3,C,Uh so we could just basically use one just wheel and uh user could use just the wheel to do everything with,IS1001c
661.0,661.28,A,Yeah .,IS1001c
661.3,663.13,C,the channels in that case .,IS1001c
664.23,668.93,A,Maybe the wheel will be a good advantage over our competitors .,IS1001c
669.71,669.99,B,Mm-hmm .,IS1001c
670.79,680.58,A,Because otherwise it's pretty standard apart the fact that it's very simple . So maybe it's worse to uh,IS1001c

685.45,688.3,C,"Yeah , I guess the market researcher will tell us all about that .",IS1001c
