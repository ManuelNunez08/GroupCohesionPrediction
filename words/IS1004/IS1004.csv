221.52,236.83,B,"I have one in mind , so uh I'm gonna about the uh spider because you can actually draw it pretty well in the corner of a white board . The spider has a spider lives in a web",IS1004a
242.65,292.16,B,"and uh it has eight legs , and uh it can move all about the web in two dimensions . Unless it's a three dimensional web which y they have sometimes . There are some spiders that live in like that have like uh kind of a a big ball of a of a web . And uh the other thing is some spiders can actually uh fly like uh they have uh they let out like uh a stream of like the web building material but it's it acts like a parachute so they can actually kind of go and find new uh build a new web somewhere else . So I think they did this in uh in Charlotte's Web that movie that little uh well it's actually a book first but uh um at the end all the the spiders kinda flew away . So",IS1004a

That's the way they walk . And that's very peculiar about them . None of the other animals walk like this . And they are very useful to human beings . At least few few hundred years ago when there was no means of transportations or something , or when they had to carry huge um loads from one place to another , elephants were very useful .

And we should target the inter an international market .",IS1004a

So s people are uh are worried about the the shape of the of the remote control .

795.54,843.21,B,"Great . Okay so um while uh researching this this topic I first of all just thought of a couple of things that I would like to see in a remote , and just uh looked to see if they're actually available in any current remotes , and then also searched for which are the top-rated uh remote controls on Epinions dot com , which is a a you know a a customer um written basically review site . So um there's a pretty wide range of uh remote controls these days and and uh this remote control on the right here is is one of the more extravagant , but it's not really it's by no means uh mm you know on it's own in being so expensive . There are a lot of expensive remote controls out there",IS1004b
842.54,844.17,A,Looks like a P_D_A_,IS1004b
843.21,844.26,B,. So,IS1004b
844.17,844.17,A,?,IS1004b
844.26,905.63,B,"yeah it doe it's well basically all the functions uh are controlled through through the L_C_D_ screen except for the really really kind of main functions , which have a couple of of their own buttons . Um and if you look at a lot of the universal remotes out um on the market , I know we're working on television remote , but a lot of the universal remotes out there have uh have these L_C_D_ screens which kind of helps when you're using multiple uh devices I suppose because you can have multiple kind of functions d different functions on the screen at different times . But um the thing that I find most interesting about this remote control , and it's kind of difficult to uh to see in the slide , but it has a scroll wheel on it , which is kind of like uh a mouse scroll wheel , which I think is it's a really kind of important design aspect um is it's 'Cause the thing is what a what we the presen this presentation we had is what we want the remote control to actually do . And obviously the the simplest thing that a remote control does is it just change",IS1004b
905.45,905.75,C,Change,IS1004b
905.63,905.9,B,the,IS1004b

906.7,906.88,C,. Yeah .,IS1004b
907.13,922.27,B,. Now um uh the I think that a scroll wheel is actually pretty a pretty handy way of of changing the channel . 'Cause I know when I um when I use the remote to change the channel I very rarely use the numbers on the on the,IS1004b
922.2,922.62,C,Mmm-hmm,IS1004b
922.27,922.91,B,pad . I usually,IS1004b

922.91,924.37,B,use the up and down,IS1004b
923.81,924.22,C,. Yeah yeah .,IS1004b
924.37,948.67,B,"because most channels are you know two digit numbers and you have to press you know a special button to enter a two-digit number , and then two numbers , so that's just uh it's annoying . So I think a scroll wheel is is quite handy . Now um the the scroll wheel is is much more useful if you have an L_C_D_ screen , and this brings us to the the point you were mentioning before about the internet uh capability .",IS1004b
948.77,949.11,A,Mm-hmm .,IS1004b
949.78,1047.2,B,"One possibility , if we now we need to still talk about the price point because obviously a lot of this stuff can't be done for twenty five Eu uh Euro , but one possibility is to download program information into the L_C_D_ screen so that instead of actually saying I want to I want to go to channel thirty seven because I know this programme's on , you know , often you don't know what ch what channel it's on , or you don't know what's on . If you have a list of of programs on your L_C_D_ screen you just scroll to that program rather than to a channel . So if you think about it's kind of like a you know in mobile phones now you don't use you don't remember people's phone number , you remember their name and you go find that name and ring it . So this would be pretty kind of a handy thing to have , but um we we really need t to discuss the price . So , I mean there are there are uh cheaper this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it's it's it's very simple , there's only a few buttons , but al each of those buttons does something different in a different context . So this is something else we might wanna consider , is really kind of limiting the number of buttons , because this is the top rating uh universal remote control on on Epinions . It it's really uh maybe worth thinking about limiting the number of buttons as much as as possible um because really I think people want to be able to find the button they're looking for without even looking at the remote control . And was saying before about having different size buttons for different you know frequently used uh tasks , but I think also you know the location and and shape of the buttons is important , but also the number of buttons . So if you have too many buttons it it it increases the the difficulty of finding",IS1004b

Um okay , so , I think um one of the really kind of useful things you can do with with internet connectivity would be to have this a programme driven interface rather than the channel number . So if we can have a higher priced uh remote control I think that would really be worth uh something that would be worth implementing . Um mm there's the L_C_D_ screen , um which maybe maybe is too expensive , um but I think also at the scroll wheel , I haven't mentioned it here , the scroll wheel could be used without an L_C_D_ screen , just for changing channel numbers easily .

Say you have like um a little another little kind of base unit that can also receive signals as well as the television where you can , say uh , change the lighting in the room . You know that would be something maybe you could sell as an extra , so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development , but , you know , later on you could you can you know you also , selling the potential of the device .

1476.75,1477.12,A,Yes sure .,IS1004b
1477.31,1527.65,C,"? Yeah so this is the design which we are thinking so . We are having a power button and the switch , which is not much , and then we are having the which is to indicate whether the power is on or not . And then there are two kind of things which can be so one is the button interface which has not been shown because because of lack of time . So we could not put that . So now where the A_S_R_ decoder is sitting , similarly there are different kind of interfaces which could be there . So there is A_S_R_ decoder which could be there , and then there could be another scroll button scroll scroller , and then there could be buttons , and all of them they will just do the decoding and put it in the math put it in the proper message format . And then there is there is the chip which is sitting , the green one , and it converts it into bit codes , and that bit codes are sent by the infrared device to the receiver .",IS1004b
1528.55,1528.82,A,Okay .,IS1004b
1529.83,1544.99,C,So this is the easiest design the there could be . So th an A_S_R_ decoder we can have things in . To have different technologies . So this was the my personal preference was that we can have A_S_R_ sitting there on the remote control,IS1004b
1544.98,1545.06,B,You,IS1004b
1544.99,1545.38,C,. Yeah,IS1004b

1545.44,1556.75,B,"you could actually train the remote control as you're using it by saying you know turn volume up , and you press the uh press the button like uh s people teach sign language to kids f well",IS1004b

1541.21,1552.75,B,Well I actually did um think about it myself but I thought you know because you could potentially you know you could be pushing it down as you scroll it for a instead of a turbo,IS1004d

1747.99,1750.11,A,Oh yeah it's really creative .,IS1004d
1752.25,1765.44,B,And uh but I think one thing we m missed out of this whole process was a um like a focus group with the actual people we're targeting . We needed some of these kind of young trendsetters,IS1004d
