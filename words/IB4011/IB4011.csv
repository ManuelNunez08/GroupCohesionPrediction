66.68,66.83,C,Mm-hmm .,IB4011.
67.56,72.67,D,"and um I I will present you three des different design , we'll discuss it . So",IB4011.
72.59,73.05,A,Okay,IB4011.
72.67,73.09,D,first we,IB4011.
73.05,73.05,A,.,IB4011.
73.09,79.4,D,have to decide for um a movie . So I think we all prepared documents .,IB4011.
79.92,80.01,A,Mm-hmm .,IB4011.
80.11,80.29,C,Mm-hmm .,IB4011.
80.31,81.01,B,"Yes , I did .",IB4011.
81.38,85.02,D,So I propose that we start with uh presentation Agnes,IB4011.
84.98,85.49,A,Sure,IB4011.
85.02,85.62,D,uh sent,IB4011.
85.49,85.49,A,.,IB4011.
85.62,85.62,D,.,IB4011.
91.1,153.84,A,"Okay , so the previous movies that we've done this year were Lawrence of Arabia , Apop Apocalypse Now and Amadeus , which were all historical , serious , dramatic and somewhat actiony movies . So for this month I propose doing something different , preferably something set in the present , um something maybe dramatic but slightly less serious . So what I'd propose is actually a thriller or a mystery . And while these days people are so jaded by general movies that they tend not to be surprised by the endings in mysteries , some movies in the nineties did actually have twists that people came out saying , never saw that coming , I didn't know that that was gonna happen . And so what I'm gonna do is present you two of those movies , and before anyone says that , well , if you know th how the movie ends , you're not gonna wanna see it again , that's not necessarily the case , because a lot of people like to re-watch movies um to see where the clues were , what they missed , things they didn't pay attention to the first time around . Um so if you can go to the next slide . What I'd propose",IB4011.
153.42,153.52,B,Mm .,IB4011.
153.84,184.69,A,"is either The Usual Suspects or The Sixth Sense . Um The Usual Suspects is slightly less mainstream . Um is has a fairly large cast , notably Kevin Spacey , Gabriel Byrne , um and it was directed by Bryan Singer , it's one of his earlier movies I think . It was written by Quist Christopher McQuarrie . Um and according to Rolling Stone it's the freshest , funniest and scariest crime thril thriller to come along since Pulp Fiction . Uh",IB4011.
184.46,184.89,B,Ah,IB4011.
184.69,185.16,A,The Sixth,IB4011.
184.89,184.89,B,.,IB4011.
185.16,207.75,A,"Sense on the other hand is a more commercial movie with its famous line , I see dead people . Um it was written and directed by M_ Night uh Shyamalan and stars Bruce Willis , Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette , and it's about a little boy who sees dead people and i he sees a child psychologist to try to get him to understand why he sees the dead people , what it means .",IB4011.
208.09,208.42,C,Hmm,IB4011.
208.18,208.69,D,And actually,IB4011.
208.42,208.42,C,.,IB4011.
208.69,210.08,D,the psychologist is dead .,IB4011.
210.77,215.93,A,"Now that you've given away the twist , yes",IB4011.
213.28,215.03,B,"No , but we're the clubbers , but",IB4011.
215.93,216.35,A,. Um,IB4011.
216.44,218.43,B,"Agnes , uh I was just wondering , uh",IB4011.
218.35,218.79,A,Yeah,IB4011.

218.94,221.34,B,"uh I have here Denis's table , and when",IB4011.
221.25,221.69,D,Yep,IB4011.
221.34,221.84,B,they say,IB4011.
221.69,221.69,D,.,IB4011.
221.84,230.03,B,"that it's the freshest whatever since Pulp Fiction , well that's probably not a very long time , because Pulp Fiction is ninety four and",IB4011.
229.94,230.23,D,Mm,IB4011.
230.03,230.38,B,Usual,IB4011.
230.23,230.23,D,.,IB4011.
230.38,236.82,B,Suspects is ninety five . Okay,IB4011.
234.44,238.17,A,Send your complaints to Rolling Stone,IB4011.
236.82,237.31,B,. Yeah .,IB4011.
238.17,296.09,A,". So on the next couple of slides I'll just go through some of um more detailed stuff that we might need for administrative purposes . Um the length for The Usual Suspects um is a hundred and five minutes . Uh as you can s well , as Andrei already said , it's n nineteen ninety five . It has an R_ rating , which means that at least in the in North America it was not recommended for people under eighteen , 'cause it's fairly violent , but not so violent as other movies . Um plot outline uh five villains in New York are rounded up by the police in an unconventional manner that worries them . After release they get together for a spot of revenge , but someone else is controlling events . And the big mystery of the movie is who's controlling the events . Um it got an eight point seven out of ten user rating on the Internet Movie Database , it's sixteenth in the top two hundred and fifty movies of all time , forth in Denis's list of the top movies of the nineteen nineties , which I think was also taken from I_M_D_B_",IB4011.
295.18,295.37,D,Yep .,IB4011.
295.8,296.09,B,Mm-hmm,IB4011.
296.09,296.57,A,. Um,IB4011.
296.09,296.09,B,.,IB4011.
296.57,310.97,A,"it won several Academy Awards , including best supporting actor and best writing , um best film for the British equivalent of the Academy Awards , it was nominated for a Cesar for best foreign film . So it got a fair bit of recognition",IB4011.
310.49,310.79,B,Mm-hmm .,IB4011.
310.97,319.36,A,"despite not being um a very mainstream , high budget movie , or maybe because it wasn't a mainstream , high budget movie .",IB4011.
319.84,323.4,D,So wha what will be your argument for projecting this movie ?,IB4011.
324.18,327.36,A,"I don't think a lot of people have seen it , in fact , other than",IB4011.

Um but I think it's a very novel treatment of of war , it's uh it's no longer the b glorification of uh , whatever , combat and victory , but the plot is quite different , it's about saving one person who has a special special value in the in the movie um if only because his brothers actually were all killed , so uh the government believes that they should save at least one person from the family , and saving means actually removing from the the front , if you if re if you remember the plot . So in fact this guy , the Private Ryan is not at all the main actor , the the main a well , the main character is uh played by Tom Hanks and it's actually you can see his picture on the second page of my my notes uh Captain John Miller . So he is sent with this rather strange mission , which is not a combat mission , but they uh they want just to to get this guy back , which is in fact this guy is I think behind enemy lines or something like",IB4011.
