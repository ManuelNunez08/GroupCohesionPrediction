64.88,94.21,A,". I'll just put that there . Uh as you all know we're here to create a brand new fantastic remote . Uh I'm Nick Debusk , I'm the Project Manager . Uh we'll just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what you're doing , what your what your role is um . Go ahead .",ES2016a
94.29,138.13,D,"Okay . I am Corinne Whiting and I will be the Marketing Expert and in each of the three phases I will have a different role . In the function design phase I will be talking about user requirement specification , and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , and I'll be doing research to figure this out . In the conceptual design phase I will be dealing with trend watching and I'll be doing marketing research on the web . And then finally in the um detailed design phase I will be doing product evaluation and so I will be collecting the requirements and ranking all the requirements to see how we did .",ES2016a
138.82,139.22,A,'Kay .,ES2016a
139.55,172.24,C,"Hiya , I'm Ryan . Um I'm the User Interface Designer . Um likewise I've three different roles for each stage of design . Um the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of a remote control . Um in the concept design , the user interface , how the user reacts with the the product . And the detailed design um sort of like the user interface design , what they might be looking for , uh things like fashions , what makes wha how we're gonna make it special . That's about it .",ES2016a
172.56,202.74,B,"Right . I'm Manuel and I'm the Industrial Designer in in this project um . In the functional design phase I'm I'll be dealing mostly with the requirements , um we'll discuss what the prog what functions the the product has to fulfil and so and so on . Um I suppose we'll work pretty much together on that one . Um um in the conceptual design um I'll be pro mostly dealing with properties and materials um",ES2016a
202.18,202.58,C,Yeah .,ES2016a
202.74,222.37,B,"of our product . And uh the detailed design in the detailed design I'll be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself , um so we're pretty much working together obviously on the design front here . Okay",ES2016a
221.21,221.77,A,Okay .,ES2016a
222.37,222.37,B,.,ES2016a
224.06,326.54,A,"Um so we've got our opening , our our agenda is the opening , uh acquaintance which we've kinda done . Uh tool training , project plan discussion and then closing . Uh grand total of twenty five minutes we have here . Um so we are putting together a new remote control . Um we want it to be something original . Um of course we're a not only a electronics company but a fashion um conscious electronics company , so we want it to be trendy um and we want it to be easy to use . Um we've got the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design um which basically is is the three of you um . And w uh well um functional design um . Um do we have um any ideas of of maybe d let's just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have , and then we can go into how we're gonna design it and and how we're gonna do the detailing on it .",ES2016a
326.84,333.32,C,"Yeah . Well uh s function of remote control is just just you know , change channels is its main function .",ES2016a
333.56,343.05,A,So we want it to be um a T_V_ remote or I I mean do we want it to to do other things besides just be a a television remote ?,ES2016a
343.25,348.89,C,Oh right . I suppose you c try make it a universal remote,ES2016a
348.59,348.81,A,'Kay .,ES2016a
348.89,356.43,C,for could work on all sort of electrical products in in one person's house,ES2016a

356.43,361.57,C,". But , you know , they all sorta have the same role changing channels , volumes and then programming .",ES2016a
361.79,362.91,A,Mm-hmm . 'Kay .,ES2016a
365.94,366.33,C,I think,ES2016a

372.9,373.76,C,Ye,ES2016a

373.76,374.04,C,yeah .,ES2016a
374.19,379.44,A,", yeah , r universal remote . Um this is my first uh go-round",ES2016a

379.44,384.9,A,"with creating a remote control , so",ES2016a
383.1,386.44,D,Ours too,ES2016a

If that if we did use a hinge , or if it was just two parts , and then you'd have just sorta you you you know , your buttons .

Um I'll go over what we went over last time , which shouldn't take long . Then I believe each of you have a presentation . Um I've was sent a a couple more requirements for our remote , what they want . Um then we can come to a conclusion on uh what we want the remote to do , um and how it's going to do it hopefully . And uh then we'll have the closing . Um which we'll have forty minutes for . Uh let's see , the last meeting we went over um who was responsible for what . I'm responsible for leading the meetings , keeping the notes , uh and coming up with the final presentation . Um Corinne is our Marketing Expert . She's gonna figure out what what um the consumer wants . Um Ryan is our User Interface Designer . And Manuel is the Industrial Designer . So you're gonna come up with the ideas Ryan , and you're gonna pick 'em apart . Um we decided our remote , uh we want it to be a universal remote uh that everyone would want . Um we want to be modern , um fun , different . Uh it needs to be sturdy , um easy to find , so we gonna have that locator function . Um and we want to be different . Um and then we went over a couple of different ideas . Ball-shaped phone . The keyboard shape . Um we decided that it should probably be one-handed . Something we could use with one hand . Um and that was our last meeting . So um why don't um Do each of you have a presentation ?",ES2016b

359.6,433.0,D,". Okay . Um so first of all , the method that I used was by doing some marketing research , by um doing research on some interviews that were conducted . And then some internet research . And I was sent a report that was I think there were a hundred remote users that they interviewed . And so I will show you some of the results from that , which I think will be helpful . Um okay here are some of the findings . They said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls . And seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly . Which is a fairly significant number I would say . And eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy . So I think that earlier we were onto something when we were talking about having it be a modern cool look , I think that's definitely important . Um they say that current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . Seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot . And if anyone could clarify what that means ?

436.59,507.61,D,". Um and fifty percent of the users say that they're only using ten percent of the buttons on their remote control . And there was something else , they kept track of the frequency per hour in using certain buttons . And some of them it looks like barely need to be included at all . Of course channel selection is used the most frequently . And then teletext was the next . Volume and then power . And then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used . So I think we could definitely eliminate or somehow combine a lot of the functions into one button . Um the biggest user frustrations , as we said fifty percent of people find that their remotes are lost somewhere , and so I think a tracking device of some sort would be a good idea . They said it take thirty four percent said it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . And twenty six percent said that the controls are bad for R_S_I_ .",ES2016b

515.26,591.89,D,". Okay . And so bas okay . Um as far as speech recognition goes , um the younger group looks like they're all for it . From the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more . And it kind of just went down incrementally . The groups at the older they get it looks like the less willing they are to pay , so maybe we could discuss this and think and decide if we think it's worth investing in this . At least if we're targeting the younger groups . And so in conclusion . Some things that I drew from this are that I think we were correct . We definitely need to focus on a new modern appearance , since so many people seem to be concerned about the ugliness of their remote control . Um a multifunctional remote could be a good thing to explore . So you only have one rather than five different remotes sitting all over your room . Uh we need to simplify the remote and reduce the number of buttons , get rid of the ones that don't seem to be serving much purpose . And then lastly I thought that maybe we could discuss the idea of speech recognition . And that's it .",ES2016b

633.32,827.16,C,"Having just listened to what Corinne just said , I'll draw on some of the things as well . Some things that sort of relevant to what I wanna say . 'Kay so I'm just gonna yeah approach the technical functions design . Um the method I used was to explore the uh technical functions of a remote control . And t s simplest approach that I came to is is to change , programme and operate an electronic device remotely . I mean that's an obvious thing to say , but it's not attached to the device that you want to control . Um I had some things sent to me . Not very much . To look at similar devices . Um defined in some them . And then the personal preferences that I will suggest . Um we discussed a universal one . Um like it's just been brought up again then . But I think a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design , and po possibly within maybe the budget that we do it , um because you'd need to know all the spef specifications of a all the like electronic companies . I'm not sure have you ever come across a universal remote control yourself , but you have to i they're a nightmare to use . You have to set them , reset them to everything . Um and that would only add buttons . Whereas I think the aim is to take away buttons . So I think it'd be better maybe to concentrate on maybe just a universal one for T_V_s . Um or maybe just one that you could we could design and then different people , manufacturers could use it to set to their specifications , if if the aim is to get something that's unique in design . Um Okay here here's just two pictures of remote controls . They're just simple T_V_ remote controls . But one is uh user-centred . That is the one on the left . And you can straight away see there's less buttons . And the other one is engineer-centred where that's more uh specified for the sort of the elaborate piece of equipment it's trying to control um which appeals more to the product that we want , and on what the have said and the market research and stuff probably looking at something that should be user-centred . Fewer buttons , simpler to use , and if ten percent um is hidden away if ten percent is what's used , maybe the other fifty percent , the buttons that are used very rarely like programming , they could be hidden maybe under some remote controls you might have come across have maybe a little flip thi thing where they're hidden away . And the main buttons are the ones you or the ones you come across . Um and finally , um uh sort I've sort of covered that , our product I think should be user interface orientated . Um Like I said to concentrate on T_V_ remote control , a universal remote might be too complex . Um and as what it , the major findings market researchers have said , it's the image and the appearance that people di dislike . So that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend . And then and change the fashion of remote controls . And that's it .",ES2016b

907.09,1172.2,B,"Okay . Gonna talk to you about the working design of the interiors basically which is what dictates the design the both the interface basically and the outer appearance because this is all the stuff that needs to go in there . Right . So unfortunately the people who were supposed to do this little presentation for me obviously were too drunk to actually accomplish it , so um I'm going to do a lot of the stuff on the board . Um just This is the basic basic premise of a remote control . Um the basic function is to send messages to another system . Okay so much is clear . An energy source feeds an integrated circuit , like a chip , that can compose messages . Often in the form of infrared bits . This is the most mostly used . Um there's uh also some sound systems but infrared is the better or the more more used system . Um parts are cheaper as well . A user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages . This is where my people screwed up basically . So I'm going to explain that on the board rather . Um what we have is different components that obviously need to go in there . We'll start with an energy source . Right . Um which is usually a battery right ? Since it's not feasible to add a cable to that . This energy source of course is connected to the the user interface itself . Uh which can be buttons , whatever , which in fact controls a chip . Right ? This is the user interface and there we have the chip . Um the way this goes normally is that this chip then controls an infrared lamp . That sends out the signal . Of course the signal differs accordingly . Um depending on what the chip tells the infrared lan lamp . And Of course that's controlled , the chip itself is controlled by the user interface . The way you normally normally do it is that you add a little device such as a lamp to the whole thing as well , so that you know that it's working basically . You press something , you get a response . Which is also comparatively um important on one of those devices . Now this , what we're talking about here , or what I think should be discussed are these two components mostly . The the uh energy source for one thing can be altered . What we probably cannot alter is of course the infrared , the sending device basically , the infrared lamp . We cannot change the chip which controls the infrared lamp . Right ? These two are components that we have to use , and these are dictated by the whole function of the whole thing . Um the lamp can be put onto the desi the device . It c it doesn't have to be there . This can be discussed as well . The user interface . That's something we can also discuss . Um as we've heard uh speech recognition is the hype obviously in the moment . Speech recognition um interface , we don't know that . Or if we just do the usual button thing . Or we have a touch pad or something like that that's something we can discuss . And of course the energy source . Batteries . Solar cells . Who knows ?",ES2016b

Um then each of you will have your presentation , um and then we will need to make a decision on the concept for the remote control . And then we'll have uh forty minutes for finishing up . Um I'll go through the mee through the minutes first . Um , we just refreshed our our uh goal of making the finest remote control available . Um we decided that , or we know that we need to use company colours , company logo . Um and our Marketing Expert uh gave us some i uh information from interviews with a hundred different remote users . Um with some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before . People thought their remotes were ugly , um um that remotes zap a lot . Um they only use uh a finite amount of buttons . Um and that they often lose the it's easy to lose a remote . Um which were all things we were thinking we would wanna make it simple . Um And uh some sort of locator . Either a button or tracking device . Um And that it should look different than what's out there . Um Kind of mixed mixed response on the speech recognition . The younger people said they wanted it , older people did not . Um uh I think we decided that um the expense was not necessarily worth it , and that it was probably a gimmick , that um would increasingly wear on the consumers' nerves . Um Then the User Interface Designer um explored some of the technical functions of the remote . Um the simple versus the um the complex . The simple one being better for a user , the complex better for an engineer . Um Um and some personal preferences that were found in that would be that it should be a user-oriented remote , something simple . Um and that we didn't wanna go with a universal remote , because uh increasing cost and increasing complexity . Um we would just have a T_V_ remote . Um and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote . Have it s be something that looks different . And finally our um Industrial Designer uh gave us a rundown of how the remote will work . Um from energy source , um uh what we would use . Batteries because we don't wanna have a a cable . Um How that would power the remote and the lamp . If we were to to have one . Uh um the user interface then would connect to a chip , which would work with the infrared controls uh to send the signal to the T_V_ . Um I believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be . Um Um something that will fit into uh easily into someone's hand . And with a , just a few buttons . Just the basics . And with a scrolling um function also . Okay and I will leave that , leave it at that . So Marketing",ES2016c

363.17,363.91,D,? Thanks .,ES2016c
388.18,542.02,D,"Okay so I was looking at trend-watching . Um unfortunately I wasn't given too much information . I was given a brief executive summary , and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at . And then I'll just tell you some personal preferences that I got from that . Um okay the most important finding was that the fancy look-and-feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look-and-feel design , which I think we've kind of already discussed before . Um the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative . And again these are all things we've kind of already come up with on our own , but this just backs it up . And thirdly the remote would be easy to use . As far as fashion update , we've learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . So that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this into our remote , but we can try . Um and also , as opposed to last year , this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel . Okay so from that um , as we've already said , we need to focus on a fancy look-and-feel . Um I think we've already discovered that it's kind of hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design . But I think that , even if it's very subtle , we need to kind of trick our consumers , so they at least get the idea that they're getting something that's new and modern and sleek and Whether it's through the shape or the colours or all of that . Um for technologically innovative , we've talked about the tracking device . We brought up the idea of having two pieces , which we could discuss further . And Manuel had suggested um the energy source and the user interface , discussing some of those , um that we could change a little bit . We need to keep it simple , have limited buttons , which I think the two piece idea might be really beneficial for . Um we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables . I don't know , I mean I guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable",ES2016c
541.05,542.43,C,Oh it was sort of banana shaped,ES2016c

542.98,542.98,A,?,ES2016c
543.31,585.68,D,". Right . Or with exterior designs . But my question is , I mean the stereotypically speaking , you kind of picture males with their remote controls , and I'm not sure how they'd feel about having fruity logos on the outside . So maybe we could have something that's somewhat removable , or I don't know , different options for female , male target groups . And then the spongy feel . I guess we could look at mobile phones and other technology that's out there . C and look at different types of material that might please our users who want spongy-feeling remote controls .

650.1,919.0,C,"Okay . Why can't I see the crazy . Um yeah I talking about the interface concept and how the customer relates to , will use the , consumer will use the actual device . Um so I've looked at some of the stuff I was sent , um , try and get some inspiration . But keep in mind that our own ideas that we had . Um I was sent some information from the company saying that they , the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology , where you can program questions into such devices . They gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question , you program the answer , and the machine responds accordingly . Um okay . There's different ways of a user can use products l like a remote . Um there's a graphical use , where you you look at pictures and well on a screen . A command line where you obviously type things in , and you get a response . Um and then it ju that's just to point out the sort of inconsistent u sort of use of interface in remotes . You can't really see that picture well , but there's various different remotes , once again with lots of different buttons on , making it more complicated . So , then I had a look at new products that are on the market . Not necessarily remote controls but ones that you'll recognise . Um this is the voice , there is a voice recognition remote control , which can control mus multiple devices . I have a there is a picture . You surf your favourite channels uh with your voice . Store up to eighty speech samples , controls four devices , T_V_ , cable , satellite , V_C_R_ , D_V_D_ and audio . And you can record your own v verbal labels , that are connected to remote control functions . So the technology is there . Um the one on the left is very similar to what we drew up on the board in the previous meeting , where there has scroll down functions on the side . You can sort of just make those out . And then on the right is obviously an iPod , which is you know possibly one of the simplest things to use out there , and really is , and all that is is just a a nice big scroll menu that y you sort of go through . That is a possibility . And nothing's simpler really . Um then there's things like this , which is a a a kid's remote , where the the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before . So the remote control it o only allows them to access the channels that their parents want them to watch . And um it means that th children have a novelty of having their own remote control . So I don't know if there's a possibility of having one remote contr you know like we just had two components , maybe it can have more components you know , different remotes . Um the point made at the end there here is that you have to be sort of be need to be clear on your um devices , as to what , you know , things you use . Sometimes an arrow pointing down , which may suggest volume down , could become confused just as a V_ for volume . Just little things like that , which would need to be made clear in the design . Um I think , d carrying on from what I've already said , a user friendly remote with minimum buttons . Maybe we've so suggested this two-part thing , where if it was to have a speech recognition thing , you could maybe control that on the do it or program all that on the control bit . And then just have the simple sort of hand-held thing that we sort of devised earlier , as the actual remote . Um I don't it could be a graphical display , the actual remote contr the actual control port maybe could have like an iPod where you just sort of control through the menus . Stuff like gets more and more compli complicated . And then the the hand-held bit should be ergonomically designed . And that is it . Why am I Oh yeah . Just . Where are we ? Uh . Just to sort of show you . M they've even got things like that . Huge things . Which is just for your gr ninety year old grandma yeah ?",ES2016c

945.08,1218.81,B,"Well let's see . I'm going to bore you with a couple of descriptions of the interior . Just to to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there , and that we do have to fit the stuff in there . I've more information on possible materials um as well . What we can and cannot do . Um but let's just wait for this to load up and I'll show you what we're talking about here . Okay . The details of the components' design , as you can see there , what we have is the board , main board of the remote control . The underside , that's pretty cheap piece of of technology really top left side you can see the chip , which is the , what we were talking about , this was is the device to recognise the signals the input , and it passes it on to a row of um further transistors and stuff like that on the right side that actually amplify the signal , which later on is being , is being transferred to a infrared lamp which then um of course shines infrared light onto the television which then will recognise what signal um it's getting and will do what you tell it . Um So much for the the workings of the of the uh remote control itself . Its job is to wait for you to press a key , then to translate that key press into infrared light signals , um that are received by the television . When you press a key um you complete a specific connection . The chip senses the connection and knows what button you pressed . It produces a morse code line signal specific to that button . Right . Pretty clear . Transistor amplifies the signal and then sends the m sends the signal to the L_E_D_ which translates the signal into infrared light . The sensor in the T_V_ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal reacts appropriately . This is the circuit board from the other side . Um the lower part of it , I don't know if you can see that properly , with the green greenish board is is what we what we saw in the first the first slide just flipped over . Um you can see the circuit board itself . That's the cheapest uh way to make electronic connections basically on the market . Um what you do is you have , don't have cables , but you have the connections actually in these in these lines on the on the board . These are the actual keys that are being pressed . They close the electric circuit . That then sends the signal to the chip on the other side . That would be behind here . Um which uh sends it over to the transistors and all that stuff that amplify the signal and all that is being sent to the infrared lamp up there . Now as you can see this is the the rubber button version of it . Um the way it works is that you have the keys here . The rubber button has a little metal uh plate on the other side , which closes the circuit here . And thus gives on the signal . Now this is the simple version . Um we are talking um this this the simple and cheapest version at the same time . We are talking something more complicated of course , it's going to be more expensive as well . And not only that . Um we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell , or in the material that we could use for our outer shell . Um I've gotten some information that we could use for the case material plastic , rubber , as well . Um rubber that is used in these anti-stress balls . So it's pretty squishy . That would",ES2016c

It certainly is an expensive material , I'm aware of that , but I was given an okay . But there are certain restrictions to certain materials . Now let's first go through the list with the materials . So we what we can use is plastic , rubber , wood and titanium . Can also mix these . Um as for the energy source , um we were talking about that shortly in the other meeting . Um what we could use is , or what I was offered , or what we could use , is a basic bateer battery . Right ? Uh a dynamo . Interestingly enough . Um we could use solar cells . Or a device that was not n not further specified that provides kinetic energy . Such as like watches you know .

1340.74,1340.74,D,.,ES2016c
1341.85,1490.02,B,". Um the kinetic energy thing um might work , um but the same problem . You leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it it starts to work . So I'd say what we're stuck with really is um the basic battery . Which also makes a base station basically obsolete . We don't need that then . Um However our interface options are push-buttons . In which uh in the production of which or in manufacture of which um our company is expert . Um However we've discussed that scroll wheels are a better option . And they are possible . We have an okay for scroll wheels . Okay . Um however when it comes to the scroll wheel of the iPod I've one big objection and that is that we have to fit an L_C_D_ into the remote control as well . This however may exclude certain um materials . If you have a squishy uh kind of remote control , then an L_C_D_ screen may be affected by the movement . Hence we might not be able to put it in there . So um There's also restrictions to , when it comes to the chip . If we have a more sophistic uh sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic uh set-up that we that I've just presented , um the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well . I don't have any details to , when it comes to the cost but um it will be a significant difference . I'd rather say drop the titanium and therefore let's have a more sophisticated chip , but that's not up to me to decide really . So that's for the for the scroll wheel . Um it limits our choice and squishy is hip , so I'd say rather not go for for that . Let's see now . Um um solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex um surface or um remote control . But obviously that's not our problem um since we have decided or against solar cells , I assume right",ES2016c

1913.61,1917.48,D,So is the two piece idea out ? Or have we not decided ?,ES2016c
1919.06,1926.34,C,Well we sort of rid of that because gonna use a battery . And the base station might not be necessary,ES2016c

1948.91,1966.76,B,". So um which then , as I understand it , would probably limit the , limit again the the the use of certain materials , because they would be too expensive . Say like have a scroll wheel and uh on both of them , or have an L_C_D_ screen and so on so on",ES2016c

Um then we'll do the evaluation , and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we'll need to make , or hopefully everything will fall right in line . Um let's see , minutes from the last meeting . Um we looked at uh the the trends . We had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy look-and-feel . It was twice as important as anything else . Um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles . Um and a spongy feel . So we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype . Um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity . Um then we looked at the uh the method for coming up with our own remote . Um looking at other other devices . Um the iPod , we really liked the look of that . Um we also had uh the kid's remote for a simple idea . Um a two part remote , which was what were were originally looking at . Uh and then um there was talk of spee uh speech recognition um becoming more uh predominant and easier to use . But I think we've still decided not to go with that . Then we looked at the components um the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips , um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote . Um and basically how , what were making for the prototype . So I'm going to leave it at that and let you guys take over .",ES2016d
