So , the general outline of uh new project will be we first uh go through a functional design phase . Um You all get uh um certain task uh in this uh in this phase and uh then we will meet again and uh discuss this functional design . And the same holds for the uh ph two phases uh after this , the conceptual design and after that a a more detailed design in which the the final project should get its definite shape .

870.17,871.47,A,Mm,IS1000b

871.47,871.47,A,.,IS1000b
871.52,882.82,D,I think in the product it is important . So basically um the basic function of a remote control is to send uh messages to another system that is fixed,IS1000b
881.91,882.13,A,Mm-hmm .,IS1000b
882.82,894.26,D,". And so an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , the chip , that can compose messages , usually uh through a um infrared bit",IS1000b
893.47,893.68,A,Mm-hmm .,IS1000b
894.26,926.22,D,"and uh the user interface controls the chip and accordingly the the messages , alright . So my method for um designing the yeah the work design uh yeah first the the main point is that I would wish to to make a really functional product . I would prefer to have very functional um capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and doesn't work",IS1000b

934.53,934.72,A,Mm-hmm .,IS1000b
935.32,963.48,D,"and um w to to we should agree on what are the technical functions uh for this remote control and I show you the the working design . So um basically uh here is a really large view of what we want . Uh we want an on off button , it can be uh it's simple but it's it's important",IS1000b

963.48,998.54,D,", and also uh the to both channels as well as other buttons that come after , right . So the components I quickly draw here , is that in this part you have the remote control the the sender and on the other part the receiver so that's my method is um will be to well my aim would be to uh design the and choose the chips and the infrared um components to build the remote control right",IS1000b

1261.48,1273.34,C,"Like so . Well . So um I'm going to talk a little bit about the technical function so wha what actually it's about what is the user going to do , I think my last",IS1000b
1273.33,1273.52,A,Mm-hmm,IS1000b
1273.34,1273.86,C,presented,IS1000b
1273.52,1273.52,A,.,IS1000b
1273.86,1275.53,C,what is going inside,IS1000b
1275.08,1275.23,A,Yep .,IS1000b
1275.53,1308.45,C,", so what's the user is going to see from the outside and how he is going to use it . So well the approach is that uh basically the idea is to send a message to the T_V_ set , as Mael has pointed , and it will be decoded by the T_V_ and usually we it is easier to have uh keys or buttons with which people can uh press and then um changing a button will basically uh change the message which is being sent to the T_V_",IS1000b
1308.33,1308.42,D,Mm-hmm .,IS1000b
1308.45,1331.95,C,"and uh um a and basically it sends an internal signal and decoded by the receiver . So p as um Anna has said that this ki people are interested in things which are you don't need to k press the keys , people are can have a speech recognition but this is uh s a question which will we have to see later . But",IS1000b
1331.63,1331.85,B,Mm-hmm .,IS1000b
1331.95,1343.3,C,"in the present scenario is that you have certain keys and you press it like your mobile phone , and it sends a message to the T_V_",IS1000b
1341.62,1341.73,B,Mm .,IS1000b
1342.37,1342.51,D,Yep .,IS1000b
1343.3,1416.01,C,". And um so generally mm I don't have some figures sorry but um so there are two kinds of uh remote if you popularly in the household , actually so you have a standard T_V_ remote where you have just a on , off button and play , uh volume change and uh keys for the number and more than one digit option . And if you see for example righ right now uh uh even the one uh on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine , but tomorrow you might have one fifty channels you know to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows , but uh uh . Then there is uh this is the standard one with without any fancy thing you know like i it doesn't have teletext option , it can without any , it's a very simple thing , um which which you can vouch . And then you have uh what's the v video remote file which is like usually it has almost all the keys over there and , but it then it has other options like stop uh and then you play the movie or uh or fo fast forward the movie or",IS1000b
1416.0,1416.37,A,Mm-hmm,IS1000b
1416.01,1416.65,C,something,IS1000b
1416.37,1416.37,A,.,IS1000b
1416.65,1463.68,C,like that so i it has those so these are the standard uh commonly found remote controls in the uh market . And then whi which is generally used by the people . And then well personal preferences I would uh basically think of having a kind of aim for the next generation thing where the we could have both the uh the f a T_V_ and the remote video remote control because uh some of the keys in the video's remote control and the T_V_ they could be integrated together so that uh we could um aim for the like in the f coming future um that type of uh applications,IS1000b
1463.09,1463.78,A,Okay,IS1000b
1463.68,1463.77,C,with,IS1000b
1463.78,1473.31,A,". How would that work ? So you've got say maybe a V_C_R_ and a T_V_ which are separate , so you on my one at home I've got a V_C_R_ remote which then changes the channel on the V_C_R_",IS1000b
1473.08,1473.31,C,Yeah .,IS1000b
1473.31,1474.8,A,and doesn't do anything on the T_V_,IS1000b
1474.64,1474.88,C,Yeah,IS1000b
1474.8,1474.96,A,", so",IS1000b
1474.88,1474.88,C,.,IS1000b
1474.96,1481.1,A,is it gonna be like a switch on the remote that says t use the T_V_ or use the V_C_R_ ? or does it know which one you want to use ?,IS1000b
1481.66,1491.8,C,Um actually um you could you could think of um having s a y you can have a key which could tell y it could go to the video,IS1000b

1502.61,1517.16,C,V_C_R_ option and you could play it or You can also think about having like um I in a few days you will be ha in in few ye coming years you might even have a system where you have a separate uh sitting setup box and,IS1000b

253.85,266.54,A,Mm-hmm . Okay so this is just a presentation on uh the trends that we're gonna use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment . Um can I just put this on ?,IS1000c
271.67,374.59,A,"So we have to work out a way what we can do with our product to make it stand out and make it so people wanna buy it . Um . This is to do this I will not remove my microphone . We basically used um some focus group surveys which I went through with you last time , the main results of that , and um some research on the current design um and fashion trends that are out there at the moment um , and as part of this The important aspects that came out were things that we've already discussed really . The most important by far was the look and feel of it . It needs to be something that's very different from everything else out there . It needs to stand out . It needs to be not functional like the rest of the things out there at the moment . Most people find remote controls boring at the moment , we need to have something that looks interesting , that looks exciting , that will stand out . People will wanna buy it . Um That was twice as i important as the next item on here which is that it has to be technologically innovative has to have something else , apart from just the look of it . People have to then think about it and say got something there that I want . That's a really cool feature , and it has to make them wanna buy it again . Third on the list , and again innovative was twice as important as this last um aspect , it has to be easy to use . So they have to be able to be able to look at it and have some intuitive idea of how to use it um . Drawing on the fashion trends at the moment , uh fruit and vegetables um . This is basically talking about just the the feel of it , so probably not the smell of it , but the bright colours , um",IS1000c

377.87,387.73,A,", and a spongy feel . Um I had a talk to the design people about this , but having a remote that's tactile , that feels different , that would be really cool . That would make it stand out",IS1000c

387.73,388.12,A,. Um .,IS1000c

418.08,418.39,B,Okay .,IS1000c
419.92,455.49,A,"So as far as the design goes , the very most important aspect was the design , to the customers . So going with the fruit and vegetable idea , we've got the bright colours , so makes it stand out , the oranges and the the bright yellows and the florescent colours , part of the fruit and vegetables um . Going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones , they've all got those a lot of them have the changeable covers , so they can choose what colour the outside is . That's one way of looking at it um . Textured feel we just talked about . Maybe it's",IS1000c

455.49,465.29,A,"another way of doing that . So if it's part of the the changeable covers then may maybe they can choose a different texture , a spongy one or a soft one or something like that . So they can choose it li as they want to",IS1000c

Also just the way that a lot of industrial design is going into mobile phones at the moment . They're big selling items . People put a lot of thought into that so we can leverage off that , and we can start using some of their ideas . Um back to technological in in innovation , not quite as important , but still a big issue . Um we talked about having a way of finding a remote control if it's been lost , uh that's one thing we could look at . There are other aspects like L_C_D_ screens and speech recognition which weren't I don't think , in my personal opinion , gonna be worth the extra expense and the extra effort that will go into them",IS1000c
