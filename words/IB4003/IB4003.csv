54.77,173.59,A,"Um , so hi everyone . Thanks for coming to this meeting . Um well as you all know the topic of this morning's meeting is uh the fact that we're moving and we are going to get more space . So that's a very good piece of news . Uh but we also have to find out how we use this space . So um if you want , I'll just give a brief overview of what's happening and then we can uh talk about , well , arranging these new uh the new office space . So um in case you haven't seen the the documents uh let me just uh show you very briefly the the configuration of the the space . So um well , there is nothing much to say . Well you know how many of us are are present and you know that we are um a bit tight actually in our present location . Uh that's why actually the university finally um allocated us this uh this part of uh the Unimail building . So it's at the sixth floor . And it's uh sort of contiguous rooms as you you can all see from uh from here . Um so the the the one P_ , two P_ , three P_ means the the number of persons . As you can see we have several corridor um with a number of uh of uh of rooms , of one person rooms , two person room and and three person rooms . Um actually I think Agnes did this nice drawing so she even put the the view , so we have the old town on one side , and the mountains on the other two sides . Uh we have some bathrooms for us . Uh and a courtyard which actually means a sort of uh shaft , because uh the court is uh down at uh the first floor",IB4003.
172.96,173.72,D,"Andre , just , yeah",IB4003.
173.59,173.59,A,.,IB4003.
173.72,187.53,D,", just a a clarification question , are they number of people per room indicated strict , or can we play around with ? I mean if there are two people , is it really that you can't put three or uh two and a half or uh how how was it",IB4003.
187.49,188.02,A,Well,IB4003.
187.53,188.45,D,calculated,IB4003.
188.02,188.57,A,", it's a bit",IB4003.
188.45,188.45,D,?,IB4003.
188.57,195.4,A,"difficult to say , because um in fact we have some constraints in terms of furniture . Uh they are here",IB4003.
194.84,195.09,D,'Kay .,IB4003.
195.4,227.5,A,". So um well , your your person Your your question actually is answered maybe by the third item . So each person should get um , well , it's a sort of desk , it's made of two pieces and it looks like a corner . With , of course , a chair . Uh a filing cabinet that goes under the desk uh and , well , we can put hanging shelves over the the desks . So I'm not really sure it's possible to get three um three desks in a two person office . But um we could",IB4003.
227.38,227.58,D,Mm-hmm,IB4003.
227.5,228.41,A,try,IB4003.

228.41,239.45,A,". What's What should be said here , I don't know if , well , you I I will maybe distribute now documents if you don't have them . Maybe it's easier . Do you need something , Martin",IB4003.
239.3,239.71,D,I have,IB4003.
239.45,240.46,A,? Um,IB4003.

246.63,246.86,B,Mm-hmm .,IB4003.
248.02,267.8,A,". So in fact there are more places than people , so we won't be that constrained . Uh as you know some of us and some of you here actually , Martin and David are part-time . So it it's for the moment quite comfortable . Normally we should even get an extra uh an extra place for , you know , temporary people coming to work on",IB4003.

287.83,287.95,C,eighteen .,IB4003.
287.95,297.81,A,"of the issues uh here , it's probably not on the slides , is that we would like to have uh , unlike what had until now , a lounge or reading room",IB4003.
297.33,297.55,D,Mm-hmm .,IB4003.
297.81,301.15,A,uh in one of the the offices . So in one of the rooms .,IB4003.
301.4,302.21,C,Do we really need that ?,IB4003.
303.29,314.13,A,"Um , I think quite a lot of people e expressed the need for that . So if we could do it , then I think it would be much nicer . Um let me also uh st say",IB4003.
313.89,314.71,D,And Susan,IB4003.
314.13,314.97,A,something,IB4003.

315.33,315.33,A,.,IB4003.
315.61,322.68,D,"we spend to for discussions about that room , so you should be able to valorize this if",IB4003.
322.6,322.91,C,Okay,IB4003.
322.68,323.04,D,possible,IB4003.

323.43,324.13,A,"Yeah , I I",IB4003.
324.03,324.17,D,But I,IB4003.
324.13,324.36,A,think,IB4003.
324.17,324.38,D,still,IB4003.
324.36,325.45,A,so,IB4003.
324.38,325.6,D,agree with you that the b the,IB4003.
325.45,325.45,A,.,IB4003.
325.6,328.5,D,"we are not so we are not so large , as far as space is",IB4003.
328.41,328.77,C,Yeah,IB4003.
328.5,329.12,D,concerned,IB4003.
328.77,328.77,C,.,IB4003.
329.12,335.5,D,. Uh because fifteen people to put in there eighteen positions,IB4003.
334.65,335.04,A,Mm-hmm .,IB4003.
335.5,343.37,D,", so uh to the best uh if you take uh two people room for the reading room , then you have",IB4003.
342.98,344.89,A,"Well , sixteen",IB4003.
343.37,345.32,D,uh sixteen places,IB4003.
344.89,345.57,A,slots for,IB4003.
345.32,345.6,D,. Mm,IB4003.
345.57,346.01,A,fifteen,IB4003.
345.6,345.6,D,.,IB4003.
346.01,348.33,A,people . So it's still should be feasible .,IB4003.
348.63,349.6,D,"Yeah , that that also means",IB4003.
349.46,350.01,A,That's,IB4003.
349.6,351.36,D,that the growth will be zero .,IB4003.
352.42,357.82,A,"Yeah , I think that's quite important to manage some space . Maybe we can think of , yeah , some two",IB4003.
357.66,358.23,D,Visiting,IB4003.
357.82,359.0,A,or three,IB4003.
358.23,359.15,D,visiti visiting,IB4003.
359.0,359.21,A,", yeah",IB4003.
359.15,359.9,D,researchers,IB4003.
359.21,360.66,A,", for visiting people",IB4003.
359.9,360.83,D,", students coming",IB4003.
360.66,361.15,A,. Correct,IB4003.
360.83,361.56,D,for exchange,IB4003.
361.15,361.15,A,.,IB4003.
361.56,362.56,D,students et cetera,IB4003.
362.16,362.47,C,Yeah .,IB4003.
362.56,362.56,D,.,IB4003.
362.86,433.56,A,"Mm-hmm . Okay , so let me finish with the the constraints which are almost done . So we also need to to find the a spot for the photocopier , the fax machine , and the printer . The fax , you know , is very small , but um the photocopier is quite huge , and the printer is uh well ab this size . Um okay , the offices comes with white boards . Not very uh very important . Uh the furniture that w each each person has and uh you have a list of people . So the thing uh you you ought to know is that we're not the only ones that w we're thin that that are thinking about uh for well , about putting people i in these rooms . Um there is another group that is also having discussions . So the idea is that today we'll just try to f start seeing the main constraints and then you have time to to go and think about it uh ask the people you know , your assistants , for instance , and at the next meeting we'll try to to come with one solution . Uh , the other group will also propose a solution and then there will be another negotiation . So",IB4003.
433.49,433.76,C,And,IB4003.
433.56,433.78,A,w,IB4003.
433.76,435.99,C,if we don't get this space then what happens ?,IB4003.
437.36,440.11,A,Uh if i if we don't get these,IB4003.
439.12,439.89,C,"These , yeah .",IB4003.
440.11,441.43,A,"? Um , well",IB4003.
441.22,441.45,D,We j,IB4003.
441.43,441.93,A,basically,IB4003.
441.45,442.14,D,we stay,IB4003.
441.93,442.15,A,they are,IB4003.
442.14,442.35,D,where,IB4003.
442.15,442.75,A,promised,IB4003.
442.35,442.8,D,we are,IB4003.
442.75,442.87,A,to,IB4003.
442.8,442.8,D,.,IB4003.
442.87,449.37,A,us so uh Do do you think there are chances that they take from us one of the rooms or uh,IB4003.
450.08,450.44,C,Okay .,IB4003.
450.97,454.5,A,"Yeah , I I I think it's uh Uh",IB4003.
453.56,454.69,D,No the the the chances,IB4003.
454.5,454.81,A,", yeah",IB4003.
454.69,454.9,D,might,IB4003.
454.81,454.81,A,.,IB4003.
454.9,456.84,D,be that there are more people to put in that space .,IB4003.
456.98,497.38,A,"Yeah i yeah , that's one of the the problems . I think maybe we should take this into account and maybe think of some of the bigger rooms with four people , one being temporary or or part-time . Um okay , so maybe we could try to to see now what would be the main options . Say the general uh , well , arrangement options . Do you think that we should put people , say , according to projects for instance ? In in the table that um that we have , uh we also have the uh uh the p the main projects on which the people are working . So how",IB4003.
496.83,497.5,D,"Andre , sorry for",IB4003.
497.38,498.36,A,Yeah,IB4003.
497.5,498.7,D,"interrupting , but uh one",IB4003.
498.36,498.64,A,. Mm-hmm .,IB4003.
498.7,523.39,D,"again clarification question , what is the real margin of manoeuvre that we have for these discussions , because uh at least we are half per cent uh fifty per cent of from E_P_F_L_ and uh sometimes you have meetings where w y the the decision is already taken , so uh um you can spend quite a lot of time discussing things , so what what will be the impact of what we will come out",IB4003.
522.92,523.55,A,"Oh , actually",IB4003.
523.39,523.57,D,come,IB4003.
523.55,523.74,A,what,IB4003.
523.57,524.01,D,up with,IB4003.
523.74,524.91,A,is fixed,IB4003.
524.01,524.01,D,?,IB4003.
524.91,539.91,A,"is the n the number of rooms . This we cannot really change . I mean at least not us , it would be much more difficult to get another another room for instance . But what is absolutely n not fixed is the arrangement of the people in the rooms",IB4003.
539.91,540.35,D,So,IB4003.
539.91,540.41,A,. So,IB4003.
540.35,540.65,D,", another",IB4003.
540.41,540.9,A,basically,IB4003.
540.65,541.34,D,way of a,IB4003.
540.9,544.12,A,we are all the permutations are possible at the moment,IB4003.
543.8,544.16,D,Another way of,IB4003.
544.12,544.12,A,.,IB4003.
544.16,551.96,D,"asking the question , is there any other group already working on uh on the how this should be uh should be allocated ? Or are we the",IB4003.
551.81,552.22,A,Um,IB4003.
551.96,555.12,D,the one that is supposed to do the p the the p position for it ?,IB4003.
555.41,569.56,A,"Well , what we are looking for is a solution that suits everyone and that makes the maximum of people happy . So uh the other group is , uh I don't think we have to see them as competitors , but they are just trying to to find another local optimum . Or",IB4003.
569.44,569.58,D,But,IB4003.
569.56,570.06,A,l,IB4003.
569.58,570.27,D,wha why,IB4003.
570.06,570.26,A,uh,IB4003.
570.27,572.38,D,why don't they have any representative here . I mean,IB4003.
572.6,574.1,C,"Yeah , why didn't we have a meeting together ?",IB4003.
574.21,574.86,D,Yeah,IB4003.
574.57,574.89,B,"Uh , they",IB4003.

576.05,576.05,D,?,IB4003.
576.11,582.5,B,uh uh uh Andre and Agnes will discuss about it with . You are the rep representative,IB4003.
582.05,583.27,A,Yeah,IB4003.
582.5,583.61,B,of this group actually,IB4003.

583.61,583.61,B,.,IB4003.
583.9,605.21,A,"uh we Yeah . I I think that's Yeah , there is no real competition between the two , but we'll just try to find at least two solutions and see how how close they are , actually . It's it's I think well the m the people who who decided this thought it was the best solution to , mm well , you know , find two two kinds of opinions . Yeah",IB4003.
604.91,605.11,D,Okay .,IB4003.
605.21,610.36,A,". Well , we could have been eight h sitting around here and and talking , but I think it's it's more difficult .",IB4003.
610.7,624.87,D,"No , but you know that that's a standard thing . It's Suppose that somebody for some strange reasons want to be in the corner and we don't know about that , we'll put them put her or him somewhere else , then we will do plenty of work for nothing",IB4003.
624.68,625.01,A,Mm-hmm,IB4003.
624.87,625.23,D,", because",IB4003.
625.01,625.01,A,.,IB4003.
625.23,626.76,D,we'll not have this constraint . We'll not,IB4003.
626.6,626.91,A,Well,IB4003.
626.76,627.74,D,be aware of this constraint .,IB4003.
628.36,631.61,A,"Exactly , I think So so today the goal is not to to find the solution",IB4003.
631.54,631.63,D,Oh,IB4003.
631.61,632.03,A,today,IB4003.
631.63,632.3,D,", okay",IB4003.

632.3,632.3,D,.,IB4003.
632.33,633.84,A,set some constraints,IB4003.
633.72,633.92,D,Okay,IB4003.
633.84,634.05,A,and,IB4003.
633.92,633.92,D,.,IB4003.
634.05,645.37,A,"then go and see the people and find out if they have any preferences . Obviously we won't be able to accommodate all the the preferences , but at least we'll find the most uh the most important ones .",IB4003.
645.59,646.89,C,"Well , certainly we have",IB4003.
646.75,646.97,A,P s,IB4003.
646.89,647.02,C,to,IB4003.

Um so since all of you have a copy of the uh , well , of the drawing , I think for the next time , m maybe you could come with a concrete proposal with uh names on it . But let us try to see today whether we prefer to organise people , say , by projects or just professor and assistant .
