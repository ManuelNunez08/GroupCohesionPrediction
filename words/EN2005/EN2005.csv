197.02,439.54,A,"corpus . But uh that was not uh well picked up in the AMI corpus , which is supposed to be . So uh and currently I'm more interested in see uh uh , yeah , analysing the discourse structure in multi-party meetings . This is what I'm going to present here . So uh uh in this presentation I'm going to see how we could analyse utterance to utterance relations in multi-party meetings . Um 'Cause meetings is a lit different from normal text or a n a normal dialogue or monologue . So interactivity is a concept is a concept that I'm using to distinguish the two uh uh extremes of uh of interac uh of discourse in meetings . And uh for dialogues uh and monologues I think we might have to use different uh concepts to m m uh model the discourse structure . Then uh I w I will uh give a very uh rough plan for the next uh couple of month . And finally I I will intr i introduce some related work , yeah . So the big question that I'm concern here is what's the relationship between utterances in multi-party meetings , or how do we analyse discourse structure right above utterances instead of uh those high level intentional structure of discourse ? So the concern here is about the very local low level utterance-to-utterance relations in multi-party meetings . Uh this is the local discourse structure . So the uh building block of that kind of uh structure would be the uh utterance and possibly one of its properties , the dialogue act which we're currently uh working on or uh and uh for meetings , yeah , so I've mentioned uh uh before that meetings is a bit different from uh monologue and uh dialogues . So uh in meetings I uh from my uh reading of the one of the AMI meetings I_S_ one O_ eight , uh the uh the four meetings , I noticed that uh uh the interaction , degrees of interaction in the meetings uh varies from parts to parts . So for some part uh the interaction is very strong . So it's obviously a dialogue . But uh for some part part where the interaction is very weak , uh just uh like the uh chairman or project manager is mm uh coordinating the meeting . He's uh pushing the meeting forward , then this kind of s organ organisational structure or part . Uh uh and also other pr uh parts like uh the back-channels without any uh semantic content uh from other participants . So this kind of uh interaction might be better analysed as monologue , which uh in which there is interaction , I suppose . So",EN2005a
