I hope it won't be too long and especially that we'll make some progress on uh this uh on this small task that is putting people in our new rooms . Uh I hope you had fun in uh , well , designing something or uh asking the people about their preferences and uh things like this . So yeah , that's what I was talking about , it's for women's shirts . Um so um well , I think you remember all the constraints and the new settings , I think , you'll be more and more used to it as as soon as we move . So we have these one person , two person and three person rooms . Um and so that makes , I think , eighteen places . And we had about fifteen people and some uh spare uh spare mm well , working places to to put um may I first uh provide the answers to the the questions from the last time ?",IB4004.
75.72,78.32,C,And I also checked with uh Maggie and Pierrette .,IB4004.
78.48,107.64,A,"Oh , great , yeah . So that will be part of the your uh your solution or suggestions to solution . But regarding the constraints um there is no immediate plan to to make separations between the rooms so that means basically well , we have to do with this setting and uh it's it's quite difficult to make new doors and new walls , so I think we shouldn't count on them in the next uh four years maybe . And they don't",IB4004.

122.19,122.19,C,.,IB4004.
122.53,160.86,A,"we uh yeah the well , we cannot change the habits of the whole school just for us . Though it wouldn't be a bad thing maybe , but uh we'll see . So regarding the possibility to put four people in one of the two uh three person rooms , um well , it's not very easy , we'll have to play uh quite uh quite wisely with the furnishing . It it looks like it's not impossible , at least on the one that is a bit uh longer , on on the right . So uh the one uh here . It should be possible to put four persons . If we could avoid it , it would much simplify things , but uh",IB4004.

269.79,311.31,A,". Fortunately we were just uh the four of us . Um . Okay , so , let me get back to into the proposal after the brief interruption . Um so the names are in red . Now um well , one of the reasons at least for me for doing this was to more or less group people uh with within projects , because I I think that sometimes they ju they just discuss together and uh it's easier if they are in the same office . And um which is quite happy actually , I I also thought that some professors might enjoy , or at least uh don't don't say anything about , being with their assistants . So I was happy to hear",IB4004.

331.55,352.9,A,"it's working like this . I put the lounge in the middle . It's also one of the rooms with the fewer uh the fewest uh windows . So I think that's not a problem , because you're not going to just stay there and stare outside . Uh but it's it's nicer to have a nicer view from your office , I guess",IB4004.
349.32,351.96,D,"Yeah , but putting the printer in the lounge is just killing the lounge .",IB4004.
