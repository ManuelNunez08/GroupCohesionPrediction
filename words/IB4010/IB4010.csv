169.35,171.1,A,. Yeah,IB4010.
169.49,169.64,D,one .,IB4010.
171.1,229.66,A,". Okay , so what I was thinking is basically the previous movies that we had , which you've already mentioned in the agenda d um Lawrence of Arabia , Apocalypse Now and Amadeus , were fairly historical , serious , dramatic , and also action-ey movies except for maybe Amadeus . Um this month I was thinking of selecting something that's more in the present time , still dramatic but slightly less serious . And what I'd propose is something of a thriller or mystery . And I know that a lot of people find mystery is not really mysterious in the movies these days , they kind of can predict what's gonna happen , um but in the nineties there were some movies that did have surprise endings and that people came out saying okay , didn't see that coming , so I thought we could maybe show one of those . And even if people have already seen the movie , a lot of the times you go back and watch the movie again , and you pick up on things that you didn't really notice the first time around , or you see where the clues were and mm what led up to the",IB4010.
229.65,230.05,B,Mm-hmm,IB4010.
229.66,230.11,A,end,IB4010.
230.05,230.05,B,.,IB4010.
230.11,298.88,A,", so that's more along the lines of what I was thinking . And the two in particular that I would propose are , next slide please , The Usual Suspects and The Sixth Sense . Um I don't know if you've seen any of them . Uh The Usual Suspects was directed by Bryan Singer and written by Christopher McQuarrie . It has a fairly large cast , so I'm not gonna read all of them , but the main characters are Kevin Spacey and Gabriel Byrne . And it's basically about five criminals who get set up . Um they're arrested , they're released from prison and the get together um and plan a crime , and basically the story is told through the views of one of the suspects . Um the tag line is kind of neat , five criminals , one lineup , no coincidence and you get told the story um as uh that these f characters are being controlled um by one sort of uber-villain , and in the end you find who the uber-villain was . And I kind of like the the quote from Rolling Stone magazine , The Usual Suspects is the freshest",IB4010.
298.85,299.15,D,Which,IB4010.
298.88,299.52,A,", funniest",IB4010.
299.15,303.92,D,"which one was it again ? The guy who was controlling ? I don't remember , I have seen the movie twice , but uh",IB4010.
303.87,305.6,A,Well they ha have you guys seen the movie ?,IB4010.

312.68,316.23,A,it . I'll tell you later,IB4010.
315.43,315.43,D,.,IB4010.
316.23,342.49,A,". But the the quote from Rolling Stone is fairly accurate , I think . It's one of the freshest , funniest and scariest crime thrillers to come along since Pulp Fiction . And the other movie is The Sixth Sense with the famous line I see dead people , which the little boy says . Um it was written and directed by M_ Night uh Shyamalan and stars Bruce Willis , Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette and again has a neat twist that you find out right at the end .",IB4010.
