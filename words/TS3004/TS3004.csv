1090.86,1093.28,B,I dunno . Different colours um,TS3004b
1093.11,1096.43,D,Maybe we can give it out in different colours . You can choose blue,TS3004b
1096.0,1096.44,A,It's like,TS3004b

1153.19,1236.79,C,"Okay . Well , the working design . The method I used is uh search the web . Just the web page provided . Um Basically I'm I'm not very technical uh uh educated , but uh I could figure it out . Um basically what happens is you press a button , uh then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button , uh like a switch . And by closing that certain circuit , the chip knows uh what bu button is pressed . So like you press a one , that circuit is closed and uh Then the chip produces a pattern . Like a Morse code to uh And and sends that to the uh L_E_D_ . That's the uh light emitting diode , I think . Um and the light emitting diode is uh producing infrared light . That's un uh invisible to the human eye . And uh transmit that uh to the T_V_ . However it has also an uh a visible uh diode that's uh blinking red if you look in it",TS3004b
