7.81,140.49,B,"Okay . So as you guys know f , ISSCO is too small . Well , the building is too small for our group . So we're moving to a new building . Uh it's gonna be the building across the street . And we're actually moving in three weeks . But the problem is that the administration wants to know who is going to be in what office in the new building and where we're g we're gonna put things like the printer , the fax machine , all the big equipment . And the catch is that they have the final approval of where we put people and equipment . And they want to know where we're gonna do all this by November second . So that means basically next Tuesday . And since we don't really have any other time we have to make these decisions today . What we're getting is nine rooms for a maximum of eighteen people , which is okay , 'cause there's only fifteen of us . And all the rooms have windows luckily , so there's no fights about who gets a window and who doesn't . Um there's two views , either of the old town or the mountains and the rooms have various sizes . There's two three people rooms , five two person rooms which are on the corners of the building , so you actually get windows on two walls , and two one person rooms . That's pretty much what the building looks like . Um and then you have the number of people per room . The courtyard , because we're on the sixth floor , you can't actually go out to it , but it just means that the windows look out onto open space . Um you can see the bathrooms , the elevators are sort of further down the hall . The purple bar at the bottom , sort of on the right is the mail-boxes . All of the windows open , you can get out onto the terrace just like we can in our normal building . And the equipment that we have to put somewhere are like I said the photocopier , which is really big , the fax machine , which is not so big , and the printer , which is relatively big . Each office has a white board , a bulletin board and a coat rack . No cupboards like we have in the current offices , and each person gets their own chair , their own corner desk , so like the n the ones that we have now , um a small filing cabinet with three drawers , and by small I mean they're about that tall",IB4001.
140.05,140.24,C,Mm-hmm .,IB4001.
140.49,203.49,B,", and one sort of hanging shelf . So we don't get the bookcases like we have now , but just one shelf that's attached to the wall . And the people that we have to place , uh you can see the list there along with their position and the project that they work on . And I guess the question the first question is how we want to organise people . Whether we want to do it by rank , or by project , or I don't know , put all the P_H_D_ students together , all the professors together , that sort of thing . So the idea is that we come up with a plan . there's another group who's gonna be working on the same plan later this week . And then Andre and I have to do presentations for the university administrators on the second . So we have to come up with a plan , possibly , if we have time , a presentation , a quick presentation with arguments for why we think our plan works best . Okay ?",IB4001.
204.12,204.59,C,Alright,IB4001.
204.23,204.53,A,Mm-hmm .,IB4001.

205.9,213.29,B,"So , anyone have any ideas or I guess",IB4001.
214.12,226.67,A,Uh do we know if there will be a lot of people coming across the hall in terms of security stuff if we can I mean my idea is to put the photocopier and the fax in the hall .,IB4001.
226.8,229.26,B,Yeah . Um,IB4001.
227.61,228.32,A,Um .,IB4001.
229.26,233.23,B,I think it's the security is sort of the same as it is in the current building . So,IB4001.
232.78,233.13,A,Okay .,IB4001.
233.23,235.41,B,as long as the things are physically attached to the wall,IB4001.
235.25,235.55,A,Mm,IB4001.
235.41,235.62,B,", so they",IB4001.

238.82,238.82,A,.,IB4001.
243.28,244.3,B,It's just a question of whether,IB4001.
244.29,244.53,A,Mm,IB4001.
244.3,244.94,B,you are printing,IB4001.

249.38,251.68,D,So we only get one printer for fifteen people ?,IB4001.
252.48,261.85,B,Um well we get one sort of networked printer and then I think some of us have personal printers . I think Susan has a personal,IB4001.
261.57,261.87,A,Yeah,IB4001.

272.77,272.77,A,.,IB4001.
273.18,288.78,B,. Um . So what I'd propose is that we sort of discuss various concepts without getting into specifics,IB4001.
288.24,288.62,A,Mm .,IB4001.
288.78,291.36,B,", and then go off and think about it over lunch and then come",IB4001.

736.88,736.88,B,.,IB4001.
744.51,752.4,D,So people would like to see uh the office organised by uh by by rank like professors and students and,IB4001.
752.95,753.56,A,I don't know .,IB4001.
755.29,764.05,B,"I think Well , it's up to us how we do it . I can see benefits of both",IB4001.

765.74,765.95,B,But,IB4001.
766.61,776.99,A,"One point I can say by experience , it's really hard to share an office with three people , because it makes much more noise that only being two in an office .",IB4001.
777.9,779.11,B,Yeah . Plus the computers,IB4001.

780.43,780.86,A,. So,IB4001.
781.01,784.41,B,And we all know what it's like to have five computers in your office,IB4001.
783.43,785.05,A,Yeah,IB4001.
784.41,784.41,B,.,IB4001.
785.05,800.45,A,. So we might be It might be a good idea to first exclude one of the three person room to be the reading room and not to be necessary a room with three people . A working room,IB4001.
799.98,800.49,C,"Yeah , but",IB4001.

800.49,815.05,C,"if there are people coming in , I mean , we have these people working for uh two months , who comes in the summertime or something . I th think we should reserve a little bit space for them too . So uh",IB4001.
815.65,819.82,B,"Yeah , that's a good point , because if we take the three person room out as a reading room ,",IB4001.
820.45,821.0,C,It's quite,IB4001.
820.96,822.07,B,then,IB4001.
821.0,821.53,C,big,IB4001.
822.07,828.39,B,"everyone has an office , right ? 'Cause it's maximum eighteen . So take away three spaces",IB4001.
828.07,828.65,A,Oh yeah,IB4001.
828.39,828.82,B,and you're down,IB4001.

837.71,837.71,B,.,IB4001.
839.64,847.83,A,"So the other solution is to say , okay we use a three person room , but only with two person each time . And leave a spare space",IB4001.
