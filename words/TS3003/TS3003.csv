Uh the User Interface Designer is going to do the technical function design , user interface concept and user interface design .

N uh these functions we don't have anything to do with , only undo , you can undo a little uh piece of drawing . A blank new document for each person . Uh select a pen , eraser .

206.59,280.8,D,"'Kay . My name is Freek Van Ponnen . I'm the Market Expert . But you already knew that . Um I've done some research . We have we uh have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed um users operating remote controls . Uh we let them fill out a questionnaire . We had one hundred of these uh test subjects . Uh in addition we did some market research . Uh see what the market consists of . What ages are involved . Well these are three quite astonishing results , I thought . Um remotes are being considered ugly . F uh seventy five percent of the um people questioned uh indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly . Um and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control . So Um in addition remotes were not very functional . Fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . And fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room . So",TS3003b
281.83,282.08,B,Mm .,TS3003b
282.33,535.74,D,"some things . Then we did some research to the most relevant functions . Channel selection and volume selection um both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy . The power button got a nine . And teletext got a six and a half . So these are the most most uh important functions on a remote control . Then there are some one-time use function . That's what I like to call them . That uh audio settings , video settings , and channel settings buttons . Which are not really used very frequently , but are still considered to be of some importance . Um channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently . One hundred and sixty eight times per hour . Then these are the This is the market . Um sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six . Um Main characteristic of this group is that they're very critical on the remote control . Um they like to use new f new functions . But they also are very critical . They won't spend their money very easily . So Um the users of forty six to sixty five years cons The make up forty percent of the market . They are not really very interested in features . But they do tend to spend their money a lot easier . Um What I think this indicates for our um design . I think we should make a remote for the future . And this means we would um have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five . Uh this also makes up most the biggest part of the market , so that will also be where our main profit would be gettable . Um this would mean we would have to make a fancy design . Um The results also indicated that um about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused R_S_ R_S_I_ . Um this is certainly something to take into account . And thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control , remote control . So these are two factors that I think should be included in the design . Besides of course that the remote must look very nice . And the functionality As a lot of people indicated , they only use about ten percent of the buttons , I think we should make very few buttons . Uh this will also be uh beneficial to the design of the remote . Uh I think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised . Especially the channel selection and audio uh selection buttons . 'Cause they're used most and so they should be robust . They shouldn't break down easily . Um Then as mo as a lot of people indicated that their um remote got lost in the room , it might be and I say might be because it would um certainly boost the uh production costs a lot . But it might be a good idea to make a docking station . And this would , could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep . So you'd know where it is in the room . And in addition to this it could um recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in . Then um a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that um an L_C_D_ screen in the remote control would be preferred . This was um mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five . But up till forty five it remains feasible . This would also greatly increase the production costs but I think these are just some small factors we could consider .",TS3003b

923.84,923.84,A,.,TS3003b
924.13,1022.5,C,"I've got a presentation about the working design . Um first about how it works . It's really simple of course . Everybody knows how a remote works . The user presses a button . The remote determines what button it is , uses the infrared to send a signal to the T_V_ . The T_V_ switches to the frequency , or what function it is . So we've got um the the plate . It gots conductive disks for every button . When the user presses a button , a signal got sent , goes to the LED and transmits tranmi transmits its to the T_V_ . It's a very simple device , technically speaking . So this is a schematic overview . You've got the buttons . The power source . And uh when a button gets pressed , its goes to the chip . The chip uh controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps a normal bulb . When you press a button you can actually see your pressed button . Well um I think we should use default materials , simple plastics . Keep the inner workings simple , so it's robust . Uh I think we should focus on aesthetics , the design and the user interface , because if you're going to use high-tech materials the price is going to go sky-high . And uh you only have to design a remote once , and if you use high-tech materials it come back in every product . So it's , in my idea , it's uh it's gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in uh in the product itself . That's it .",TS3003b
1023.16,1024.01,A,Okay . Thank you .,TS3003b

Um I'm the Project Manager so I'm here to mess things up and uh tell you some new uh requirements . Um that's , we've uh got to design a um remote which is only suitable for T_V_ . Um that's because",TS3003b

1070.08,1078.27,A,"uh it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big , if we wanna have it uh for more functions .",TS3003b
1078.3,1078.53,B,Mm .,TS3003b
1078.78,1173.99,A,"So it has to be simple . Uh another point is we have to skip the teletext , because in the world of uh upcoming internet uh we think teletext is going to be uh a thing of the past . And uh it's a function we don't need in our remote control . Um internet is also mentioned in a function we can use . Uh maybe also on televisions it will be available as well . Another one is uh the customer is uh forty plus . Uh that's the the market we have to to to target , because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers . Um this is uh a bit pity for the Marketing uh Expert . Because he was uh aiming on the the younger persons . So we have to find a market which is above forty plus uh but which will suit our uh remote control , and the other way round . And we have to be very uh attent in uh putting the corporate image uh in our product . So it has to be visible in our design , in the way our device works . And uh we have to be uh very clear on this point as well . So I suggest let's have a discussion on the control functions . Yeah .",TS3003b

Um does somebody have any comments on these requirements ? Maybe ? No ? These are just the the things we thought of , so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else , just let me know . And maybe we can uh work it out .

203.97,432.03,D,"'Kay I'm uh gonna inform you about the trend-watching I've done over the past few days . Um we've done some market research . We distributed some more enquetes , questionnaires . And um besides that um I deployed some trend-watchers to Milan and Paris to well get all of the newest trends . And I've consulted some additional trend-watch trend-watchers , after the original trend-watchers return , about what the the best design would be . Um okay these are some overall findings . Um most important thing is the fancy design . Um the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor . Um innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design . By innovativeness this means um functions which are not featured in other remote controls . Um about half of , half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use . Um for our um group , we're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old , this is um , these factors are slightly more equal . 'Kay these are some more group specific findings . Uh the older people prefer dark colours . Uh they like recognisable shapes , and familiar material . And our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much the material for older people . Um this is , this image will give you a little bit of an impression about um the look-and-feel that um the remote should have . Um this leads us to some personal preferences . Uh the remote control and the docking station should uh blend in in the in the room . Um so this would mean no uh eye-catching designs . Just keep it simple and Well the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest , because this would be the These would uh be the innovativeness in the remote control . So this would be very important that we at least include these features . Um well the trend-watchers I consulted advised that it b should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped . So you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station . This is not really This is pretty much a new shape to uh older people . So they would prefer uh a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station . So it would be kinda more telephone-shaped . Um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions , one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey-black colour . The wood-like for the more uh exclusive people . People with more money . Uh the grey-black colour for well people with less means . That would be all .",TS3003c

Um yeah just um we have just to focus on the primary um functions . So uh only uh buttons uh for uh sound , um for uh on-off , um uh shifting u up uh sa uh ca channel or uh down shifting down . Um uh let's see . Um yeah and Uh we uh need some uh new a attractive functions uh uh which attract uh uh people for using it . So uh it's uh like a speak uh speech uh recognition and um a special button for selecting uh subtitles . Just uh what we uh mentioned uh last uh meeting . Um and yeah overall um user-friendly . So uh using uh large large buttons . Um It's uh possible to uh uh to make um quite cheap uh system for uh speech uh recognition .

Uh one push on the button uh you get uh uh small uh subtitles . Um double push push um , if double click , um so uh you get uh big uh subtitles , for uh people uh um uh which c f uh who can't uh read small uh subtitles .

Uh for the casing , uh the uh manufacturing department can deliver uh a flat casing , single or double curved casing . It's really up the the design that we're gonna use .

Uh for the b buttons , we can use plastic or rubber . And the chip-set , um it says simple here , but it should be advanced , because we're using an L_C_D_ uh screen . And as uh the trend-watcher presentation showed , um people like wood , but it raises the price and it doesn't really fit the image , unless we would start two product lines . Form should follow function overall . Um well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy . But depends on what we want . I think we should disc discuss that .

995.59,996.16,A,No,TS3003c

996.29,997.67,C,option . Or the kinetic energy .,TS3003c
999.41,1001.06,A,Yeah . Okay,TS3003c
1000.75,1001.13,D,And how,TS3003c
1001.06,1001.06,A,.,TS3003c
1001.13,1003.7,D,exactly does the kinetic energy work,TS3003c
1003.6,1003.76,C,Well,TS3003c
1003.7,1003.79,D,? You,TS3003c
1003.76,1004.15,C,y,TS3003c
1003.79,1004.09,D,just,TS3003c
1004.15,1005.27,C,you basically shake your,TS3003c

1005.27,1006.64,C,remote,TS3003c

1006.74,1006.88,D,it,TS3003c
1006.75,1007.0,C,then it,TS3003c
1006.88,1007.47,D,works,TS3003c
1007.0,1007.54,C,powers up,TS3003c
1007.47,1007.47,D,.,TS3003c
1007.54,1007.88,C,. Yeah .,TS3003c
1008.48,1008.84,A,Yeah .,TS3003c
1009.02,1010.1,D,Okay,TS3003c
1009.07,1009.4,B,Nah .,TS3003c
1010.1,1017.06,D,. Well personally I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it .,TS3003c
1017.24,1018.16,C,Yeah . That's true .,TS3003c
1019.23,1024.99,D,And besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete,TS3003c
1023.66,1023.76,C,Oh .,TS3003c
1024.99,1035.6,D,. And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can um get great popularity for our product .,TS3003c
1037.68,1038.13,A,Yeah,TS3003c
1038.0,1038.51,B,But,TS3003c
1038.13,1038.13,A,.,TS3003c
1038.44,1039.78,D,Um,TS3003c
1039.73,1040.02,B,what's,TS3003c
1039.78,1040.07,D,wel,TS3003c
1040.02,1043.74,B,the function ? Yeah f for loading up uh the batteries .,TS3003c
1044.23,1045.06,D,Yeah you could load,TS3003c
1045.02,1045.19,B,B,TS3003c
1045.06,1045.23,D,up the,TS3003c
1045.19,1045.41,B,b,TS3003c
1045.23,1051.96,D,"batteries , you could um insert the find the lost remote control function in there .",TS3003c
1052.8,1069.92,B,Okay but uh it won't use uh much e energy uh I I believe . Uh it's uh just a small display so I believe uh it will run on one battery for um six months or f or or more . So,TS3003c
1068.73,1069.12,A,Uh,TS3003c
1069.92,1073.29,B,I believe one battery uh is just enough . Uh so,TS3003c
1073.99,1075.74,A,Uh well I think,TS3003c
1074.9,1077.2,D,That's true,TS3003c
1075.74,1077.39,A,uh elderly people,TS3003c
1077.2,1077.2,D,.,TS3003c
1077.39,1087.73,A,just like to have everything in place . And I don't think they they like uh remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms,TS3003c
1087.18,1087.63,B,Okay .,TS3003c
1087.73,1091.07,A,. So maybe a docking station will help them give the remote,TS3003c
1090.92,1091.12,B,Yeah,TS3003c
1091.07,1091.13,A,a,TS3003c
1091.12,1091.24,B,. That's,TS3003c
1091.13,1091.57,A,place,TS3003c
1091.24,1091.82,B,true,TS3003c
1091.57,1091.57,A,.,TS3003c
1091.82,1092.03,B,. Yeah .,TS3003c
1092.41,1100.5,A,And also what you said . Um you can introduce voice recognition by uh finding back,TS3003c
1100.48,1100.7,B,Mm-hmm,TS3003c
1100.5,1100.77,A,your,TS3003c

1101.7,1102.13,B,Yeah,TS3003c
1101.87,1102.29,A,. But,TS3003c
1102.13,1102.13,B,.,TS3003c
1102.29,1114.41,A,"I think it's um more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station . So you have a but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping .",TS3003c
1114.8,1115.65,B,Okay .,TS3003c
1116.26,1118.01,A,And then we can we can still use,TS3003c
1117.93,1118.59,B,Yeah,TS3003c
1118.01,1119.21,A,the voice recognition,TS3003c

1122.65,1123.01,B,Uh .,TS3003c
1123.23,1123.58,A,That's,TS3003c
1123.34,1124.59,D,I'm wondering,TS3003c
1123.58,1123.96,A,safe .,TS3003c
1124.59,1129.54,D,um what will the voice recognition mean for the production price ?,TS3003c
1130.24,1131.59,A,Yeah . That's a good,TS3003c
1131.38,1131.98,C,Mm,TS3003c
1131.59,1131.98,A,point .,TS3003c
1131.98,1136.32,C,I don't have any information on pricing . So I'll have to ask the manufacturing department .,TS3003c
1136.65,1136.96,B,Mm .,TS3003c
1137.34,1142.95,D,"'Cause in our earlier um market research , if you'd allow me to",TS3003c
1142.65,1143.05,A,Yeah,TS3003c
1142.95,1143.05,D,go,TS3003c
1143.05,1144.38,A,", sure",TS3003c
1143.05,1144.48,D,to the flat board,TS3003c

1145.57,1145.57,D,.,TS3003c
1150.59,1168.27,D,"Um so it was open here . Um we also um asked if w they would , if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . Well you can see here , our target group would not do that",TS3003c
1167.87,1168.27,A,No .,TS3003c
1168.27,1172.29,D,. So if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control,TS3003c
1173.23,1173.37,B,Mm .,TS3003c
1173.92,1176.67,D,I would greatly advise not to do it,TS3003c
1176.47,1176.9,A,Yeah,TS3003c
1176.67,1176.96,D,. I think,TS3003c
1176.9,1176.9,A,.,TS3003c
1176.96,1181.75,D,"that would be better to uh insert in our other product , that is meant for the",TS3003c

1186.4,1191.37,C,"for the L_C_D_ screen then I guess . It's a bit higher percentage , but",TS3003c
1193.12,1209.7,D,"Um well this is Yeah but this is here the question was , would you prefer it . So that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it . And on top of that the L_C_D_ screen would um help in making the remote control easier to use .",TS3003c
1210.7,1210.91,B,Yeah .,TS3003c
1211.95,1212.66,A,Yeah,TS3003c
1212.14,1212.49,D,And,TS3003c
1212.3,1212.67,C,Okay,TS3003c
1212.49,1212.98,D,I think,TS3003c
1212.66,1212.66,A,.,TS3003c
1212.67,1212.67,C,.,TS3003c
1212.98,1217.01,D,a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much,TS3003c
1216.95,1217.3,A,Easier,TS3003c
1217.01,1217.32,D,easier,TS3003c

1217.91,1219.62,A,"? No , I think that's a good point .",TS3003c
1220.11,1230.74,B,"But uh is uh our uh research um about um bi large uh L_C_D_ sh uh display , or uh just a small one uh we want to uh use",TS3003c
1230.63,1231.76,D,Um,TS3003c
1230.74,1230.74,B,?,TS3003c
1231.76,1237.44,D,well this was for like an L_C_D_ screen like you would have on a on the the most advanced mobile phones .,TS3003c
1237.71,1238.2,B,Okay .,TS3003c
1238.48,1239.71,D,So pretty large .,TS3003c
1240.02,1240.26,B,Yeah .,TS3003c
1240.36,1250.79,A,"Yeah . I personally think the L_C_D_ screen we wanna use , with the extra information , I think nobody has anything against it . Because",TS3003c
1250.6,1250.82,B,No,TS3003c
1250.79,1250.9,A,it's,TS3003c
1250.82,1250.82,B,.,TS3003c
1250.9,1255.07,A,"just uh some extra information , and it's easy to ignore as well",TS3003c
1254.68,1254.92,B,Yeah .,TS3003c
1255.07,1279.46,A,". So if you don't wanna use it you just don't use it . And um yeah I think the um Maybe we have to uh discard the voice recognition . Because it will increase cost uh signifi uh significantly . And I don't think the I don't think it will be a lot easier to use , as well .",TS3003c
1280.08,1280.51,B,Yeah .,TS3003c
1281.22,1291.26,A,"So that brings us back to the energy . If we don't have the voice recognition , it will it won't use a lot of energy to use",TS3003c
1289.74,1290.03,B,Mm-hmm .,TS3003c
1291.26,1304.66,A,". Um So in that case we could use kinetic uh energy , but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good . And much cheaper as well .",TS3003c
1304.78,1305.0,B,Yeah .,TS3003c
1305.86,1306.32,A,So,TS3003c
1305.9,1307.14,C,And that's the best choice .,TS3003c
1307.7,1314.84,A,Okay let me just choose for the battery . That brings us to the chip .,TS3003c
1315.52,1317.57,C,Well there isn't any choice there because,TS3003c
1317.5,1317.76,A,Just,TS3003c
1317.57,1318.14,C,we're using,TS3003c

1318.53,1321.0,C,the the display . So it's gotta be advanced .,TS3003c

1323.22,1324.65,A,", advanced chip .",TS3003c
1330.09,1357.23,A,And then we get to the point of the case . Um which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well . Uh if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey . Or both ? Um as we saw there is not Yeah wood is a lot more expensive to produce,TS3003c
1355.35,1355.72,D,Mm-hmm .,TS3003c
1357.23,1369.09,A,". Um but I think it will attract elderly people who wanna have something exclusive , which they can show off to their",TS3003c

1373.12,1373.59,B,dunno .,TS3003c
1374.32,1380.52,D,I think most important factor there is the wooden colour . So it wouldn't actually have to be wood,TS3003c
