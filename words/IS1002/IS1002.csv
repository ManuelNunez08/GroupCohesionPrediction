Start,End,Speaker,Speech,meeting
91.24,150.9,A,"So we are here to talk about functional design . Now hopefully we've all got a better idea from than we did f leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now . So here's an agenda . Uh I'll open . Um you should know that I'll be taking minutes during all the meetings , as I was struggling to our last time uh and that'll be easier for me now because I'm not actually giving the whole presentation . Uh the additional points are just the stuff that we sent and that I forwarded on from upper management having a few bright ideas to make our lives painful . Um now you can all give your presentations . We can talk about the requirements and hopefully come to some decisions . Right , forty minutes for this meeting , so a bit more time than the last one . Here's the additional points I just wanted to put those in there to see if you guys had any comments on them . Uh did you all receive that email ?",IS1002b
151.33,151.64,B,Yep,IS1002b
151.36,151.68,D,Yeah,IS1002b

151.68,151.68,D,.,IS1002b
152.1,153.96,A,So does anyone have any overall,IS1002b
156.36,161.63,D,Well uh what comes up for me is that if we're gonna if we're gonna be marketing a product that,IS1002b
161.57,161.87,A,Mm,IS1002b
161.63,162.14,D,is,IS1002b
161.87,161.87,A,.,IS1002b
162.14,167.08,D,"going to be uh having no teletext , people",IS1002b
167.06,167.2,A,Mm,IS1002b
167.08,167.35,D,are very,IS1002b
167.2,167.2,A,.,IS1002b
167.35,172.34,D,comfortable with the idea of having teletext and using teletext,IS1002b
172.04,172.39,A,Yep,IS1002b
172.34,172.56,D,", and",IS1002b
172.39,172.39,A,.,IS1002b
172.56,181.12,D,"so we're not we're gonna be a new product without something that people are very comfortable having right now . So that's , from a marketing perspective",IS1002b
180.8,181.07,A,Mm .,IS1002b
181.12,189.33,D,"I I see I see a lack . And so we have to go , I think , in the other direction . What are we gonna have that makes this thing better",IS1002b
189.08,189.37,A,Well tha,IS1002b
189.33,189.59,D,than,IS1002b
189.37,197.98,A,"that first point could uh also be an op opportunity because in seeing that teletext is becoming outdated , some sort remote control that can work with the Internet there is the opportunity",IS1002b
197.53,198.61,D,Right,IS1002b
197.98,198.64,A,"that's presented , I",IS1002b
198.61,198.82,D,. Yeah,IS1002b
198.64,198.85,A,guess,IS1002b
198.82,199.13,D,. No,IS1002b
198.85,198.85,A,.,IS1002b
199.13,200.58,D,", I I agree with you . So what",IS1002b
200.33,200.75,A,Okay,IS1002b
200.58,200.96,D,I'm talking,IS1002b
200.75,200.75,A,.,IS1002b
200.96,213.3,D,"about is I see that one side we're eliminating something so we have to come up with another side which is , what are we gonna be targeting our market uh that identifies our product as better than because it doesn't have teletext it has ta-ta-ta-ta-ta . So",IS1002b
213.3,213.61,A,Okay,IS1002b
213.3,213.66,D,that's,IS1002b
213.61,213.61,A,.,IS1002b
213.66,215.04,D,that's that was my reactions .,IS1002b
215.09,218.4,A,Yeah . but but we are sort of being dictated that this should only be,IS1002b
218.15,218.39,D,Yeah yeah .,IS1002b
218.4,220.55,A,for the television . So we're quite fixed,IS1002b
220.39,220.53,D,Yep .,IS1002b
220.55,228.54,A,". So we're really probably , in terms of marketing , are looking for that's uh that's a cost winner rather than a fantastic new feature product",IS1002b
228.26,228.57,D,Okay,IS1002b
228.51,228.75,C,Yeah,IS1002b
228.54,228.72,A,. Yeah,IS1002b
228.57,228.57,D,.,IS1002b
228.72,228.72,A,.,IS1002b
228.75,232.63,C,"bu but we we're designing only the remote , we not design the T_V_",IS1002b
232.29,232.51,A,Hmm .,IS1002b
232.63,236.45,C,. So uh we're gonna be removing the teletext out of any T_V_,IS1002b
237.3,237.81,D,Yeah,IS1002b
237.31,238.14,C,that we,IS1002b

238.14,239.29,C,people use our remote with .,IS1002b
239.57,240.13,D,That's right,IS1002b
239.92,240.14,A,Hmm,IS1002b

240.14,240.14,A,.,IS1002b
240.2,240.42,D,think,IS1002b
240.32,240.48,C,So,IS1002b
240.42,240.58,D,we,IS1002b
240.48,241.01,C,it's,IS1002b
240.58,241.07,D,take with you,IS1002b

241.07,241.07,D,.,IS1002b
241.15,241.69,C,of a stupid,IS1002b
241.66,241.85,A,But,IS1002b
241.69,242.18,C,decision,IS1002b
241.85,242.3,A,there's also,IS1002b
242.12,242.29,B,Right,IS1002b

242.29,242.29,B,.,IS1002b
242.3,253.77,A,"the potential for mark there's a market here for our lost teletext . For example someone that just goes to the shop that wants a replacement wants it as cheap as possible . Twenty-five Euros is the selling price , we really have to innovate here I guess .",IS1002b
254.15,265.62,D,"That's what I'm that's what I'm talking about is is that we have to find something that is gonna be very attractive about this product 'cause somebody , some people are gonna be hap unhappy 'cause it took they can't ac access their teletext",IS1002b
265.06,265.33,A,Mm .,IS1002b
265.62,272.75,D,. Okay . 'Cause we're talking about eighty percent or ninety percent or ninety-five percent of the televisions out there are are teletext .,IS1002b
274.4,274.65,A,K yeah .,IS1002b
274.66,284.0,D,"So so it's it's not that I'm criticizing the product at all . It's just when we eliminate that then what do we bring ? What are we bringing in to take the place of this , and we have to",IS1002b
283.95,284.02,A,Mm,IS1002b
284.0,284.06,D,d,IS1002b

284.22,284.22,A,.,IS1002b
284.33,288.15,D,opinion we have to double up . If we lose one we need to bring two or,IS1002b
288.08,288.29,A,Okay,IS1002b
288.15,289.18,D,three,IS1002b

289.18,289.18,D,.,IS1002b
290.45,298.69,A,Okay I think that the last point is probably quite uh straightforward . Obviously the the w it has to be branded .,IS1002b
299.38,299.88,C,So then the,IS1002b
299.84,299.93,A,'Kay,IS1002b

299.93,299.93,A,.,IS1002b
300.2,301.27,C,R_ will be our our,IS1002b
303.57,305.24,A,On the product yeah,IS1002b
304.9,305.25,B,I think,IS1002b
305.24,305.4,A,. Can,IS1002b
305.25,305.53,B,one,IS1002b
305.29,305.51,C,I tho,IS1002b
305.4,305.8,A,you handle,IS1002b
305.51,305.59,C,I,IS1002b
305.53,305.59,B,of,IS1002b
305.59,306.14,C,tho I thou,IS1002b

307.03,309.89,C,"I think Rol Ro Rolls-Royce might mind , but don't worry .",IS1002b
310.48,334.88,B,"I think w , yeah , one of the things that we should also keep in mind um when we're doing this I mean our company's slogan is we put the fashion in electronics , right . So I think our kind of our target here is to have some kind of very like sleek nice look remote and we want it to be functional as well , but I think one of the main selling points is that we don't want it to be clunky like like this thing here . You",IS1002b
334.88,335.12,A,Mm,IS1002b
334.88,335.12,B,know we,IS1002b
335.12,335.12,A,.,IS1002b
335.12,341.21,B,don't wanna a big clunker . We want something that looks nice and it's fashionable and so,IS1002b
342.54,343.31,D,So you have this ?,IS1002b
343.49,357.93,A,"Nah . So we have three presentations , and I think we'll go in order of participant number here . So we can have a look at the working design first from participant two . That's",IS1002b
359.32,359.53,C,Yes .,IS1002b
359.83,360.29,B,That's fine .,IS1002b
360.73,360.99,A,Okay .,IS1002b
365.97,367.07,B,Okay so,IS1002b
367.33,370.07,A,Mm it's enough . But uh click it on off ?,IS1002b
370.42,467.5,B,"so you all know me , I'm the Industrial Designer . And we've some basic components that um our remote is gonna need , just basically every remote'll need 'em . We need some kinda of power d power source . Um we have to decide on our our user interface , which is his department , but the in user interface is also a major component . Um we need a programmable digital signal processor to um to take the input from the user and translate that into uh into electronic signal , which we pass to the infra-red L_E_D_ , which you aim at the television uh which and it receives that signal . You need a on-off switch um I don't know how that got in there . And uh we also need to um have the if we want a universal remote we need to have encryption codes for the different makes of T_V_s . So we need to know all the different you know all the different signals and so that'll require some memory as well . Um so here's just a basic layout of how how the remote would work . You ha the v the power source is in the upper right-hand corner there , and you can see that uh we have the user interface here which is connected to the chip which does all our signal processing , and then passes that signal on to the infra-red L_E_D_ and that signal is then emitted and received by the television at the photo-transistor . So those are the basic components that need to go into this and everything else is pretty much uh open to move around .",IS1002b
468.04,472.69,D,Now is would this be considered just a standard uh um,IS1002b
474.1,474.61,B,I think any,IS1002b
474.6,474.74,D,This,IS1002b
474.61,474.86,B,des,IS1002b
474.74,477.69,D,is not this is not cutting edge technology we're talking here . We're talking,IS1002b
477.53,477.77,B,No,IS1002b
477.69,477.9,D,about,IS1002b
477.77,477.77,B,.,IS1002b
477.9,479.54,D,existing technology,IS1002b
479.14,479.89,B,Right I think,IS1002b
479.54,482.03,D,. Nothing is being modified or upgraded or,IS1002b
481.57,482.2,B,Yeah this is,IS1002b
482.03,482.78,D,new discoveries,IS1002b
482.2,483.0,B,just,IS1002b
482.78,482.78,D,.,IS1002b
483.0,501.34,B,"this is just a basic layout of ev of all the components that w w are gonna be absolutely necessary f to have a working remote . We can add things in like if we wanted some voice recognition , I mean that I mean that you can kinda say would would fall under the user interface and the digital signal processing",IS1002b
501.26,502.02,D,Okay,IS1002b
501.34,502.46,B,chip,IS1002b
502.02,502.33,D,. Okay .,IS1002b
502.4,502.5,A,Do,IS1002b
502.46,502.83,B,. But,IS1002b
502.5,504.49,A,we have an idea of costs of different components ?,IS1002b
504.8,516.06,B,Um well the most the most costly components are gonna be the chip and the uh th it could als basically the user interface and the casing are gonna be expensive as well . Um,IS1002b
515.44,515.58,A,'Kay .,IS1002b
516.06,528.55,B,"the L_E_D_ and the the transistors and everything else are you know they're they're pretty cheap . So depending on what we want our functionality to be , um the chip could be expensive or it could be cheap . Um",IS1002b
528.05,528.34,A,Mm 'kay .,IS1002b
528.55,533.67,B,depending on the n amount of memory we need in there and stuff like that and h and h you know how,IS1002b
533.54,533.71,A,Do we,IS1002b
533.67,533.86,B,much,IS1002b
533.71,534.02,A,have any,IS1002b

534.23,534.23,B,.,IS1002b
534.43,535.68,A,figures for that yet ? No .,IS1002b
535.68,538.19,B,Uh I don't have any figures right now,IS1002b
537.83,538.05,A,'Kay .,IS1002b
538.19,542.58,B,. We uh we have to wait until we get to a more specific design phase for that,IS1002b
541.8,541.97,A,Yeah .,IS1002b
542.51,542.92,D,N okay,IS1002b
542.58,543.22,B,. Um,IS1002b
542.92,542.92,D,.,IS1002b
543.22,555.2,B,but and I think a significant part of the cost could be the actual the actual casing itself and and you know the the b the buttons and things,IS1002b
554.95,555.05,D,Mm .,IS1002b
555.2,556.15,B,like that,IS1002b

596.01,596.25,A,Mm 'kay,IS1002b
596.66,691.07,C,"This doesn't work . So yeah function design . Um you guys know me , Pedro , and um what I found is we want to do fashion and I think , honestly , we should keep technology low and just simple basically and try to aim for design . If basically a case will will cost the same if it looks good or bad so we ma we have to make it look good . Um something cute and small . The big chunky remotes are died in the eighties . So we should just go for something that people will like to actually look at . And um although mo most people will buy s televisions and everything for uh that have loads of loads of little functions and everything and they mostly end up using simple functions and little things and most the people won't won't get too mad of actually having to go the to the s to the television to , for instance , tune in their the stations . There's no need to have that in the remote . So um um as for what I would recommend for uh the the interface design , and uh I will change the colours on the on the logo , but um we should go for the user-oriented device , so simple controls and good ergonomics . Um and uh although I th I th I'm still here recommending the teletext so I'll remove that , I guess , but um we should go for",IS1002b

691.21,704.35,A,"I t I think what the the management recommendation was less that there's a worry that teletext will become outdated rather than we shouldn't have it . So I I still think if it's cheap enough functionality-wise to include , it really should be in there",IS1002b

732.24,750.49,D,I have maybe a silly question . I in the very beginning it said with the with the advent of computers there's gonna be the it's gonna be out-moded teletext . I I don't understand how those two things are connected . How does how does computers and teletext h how why is one eliminating the need of the other ? I don't understand that .,IS1002b
750.6,757.49,A,Well maybe what we're getting into here is the the idea of uh Internet through the T_V_ for example . So that might play on what,IS1002b

943.76,960.77,A,So our big questions here really are cradle or not cradle ? Do we go basic or do we go for features ? Uh d does anyone really wanna do anything with the scroll wheel or should we ditch that,IS1002c
960.32,961.03,B,Well my question,IS1002c
960.77,961.15,A,off-hand,IS1002c
961.03,961.34,B,is what,IS1002c

961.47,966.08,B,"the scroll wheel do ? Function-wise , what does that do that",IS1002c
966.02,969.14,A,Oh but that was in your presentation so wh what would you imagine,IS1002c
969.08,969.42,D,Yeah,IS1002c
969.14,969.47,A,it doing,IS1002c

969.47,969.47,A,?,IS1002c
969.58,971.95,D,wh what's the wh,IS1002c
971.21,975.72,B,Yeah . Well it's it's just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do .,IS1002c
976.85,977.23,A,Mm 'kay .,IS1002c
977.4,977.78,D,Okay now,IS1002c
977.71,977.82,C,But,IS1002c
977.78,977.99,D,what,IS1002c
977.82,978.16,C,would,IS1002c
977.99,978.23,D,I see,IS1002c
978.16,978.27,C,we,IS1002c
978.23,986.65,D,with the scroll wheel is everybody has buttons . So from a marketing standpoint I have I have another door to walk through when we have something that's unique,IS1002c
986.47,986.61,A,Yeah .,IS1002c
986.65,1001.74,D,". If it creates something more complex or more expensive , then I don't know if that makes it uh a marketing necessity .

1002.57,1006.0,A,What I understand about scroll wheels is they're they're quite expensive to,IS1002c

1068.37,1068.95,D,. I think so .,IS1002c

1078.56,1083.65,A,you're not going to be ditching it as often . It's gonna need to be more expensive because of the cradle .,IS1002c
1084.11,1084.26,D,Mm .,IS1002c
1084.88,1087.09,A,So if we can market it in terms of,IS1002c

1100.48,1118.61,A,"So our big decision then is like how do we do um like we have to decide on the details and we have to decide on well n not exactly the details , but d do we have uh What type of casing ? I personally like what you were saying about the plastic with the rubber",IS1002c
