189.55,189.71,B,Yeah .,IS1003b
191.2,195.53,D,Uh I I will focus on user interface design . Um,IS1003b
195.28,195.43,C,Mm .,IS1003b
195.53,280.6,D,"so move to the next slide . As we know our remote c rem remote T_V_ control it's very has very soph sophisticated functions , as we show from this picture . There's a lot of functions . Over , I think over s twelve or twenty s functions of a remote T_V_ control . So how can we um design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions ? Um , let's move to next slide . Um . Yeah . So I so we want to design uh elegant , easy to use inter interface . A very good example is Google . As we know uh Google it's a very successful because his um powerful function , but with very easy to use user interface . Um so move to next s slide . So my job is to uh design a Google T_V_ controller which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface .

The second is a fancy controller . The last one is uh intelligent controller . So there are three concepts in our controller . Um n next I will explain one by one , the first is Google controller . Um , so I want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions . So it's a combination of easy to use and um sophisticated functions . Uh this is a first concept of our controller . The second concept is a fancy controller , um so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very",IS1003c
